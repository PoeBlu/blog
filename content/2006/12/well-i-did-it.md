I've been resisting it for quite a while, but in an effort to cut down
on extraneous content on my web sites ([JasonAntman.com][],
[php-ems-tools.com][], and [KC2OZU.com][]) I decided to give in and
setup a blog.

The content will probably be a smattering of IT, Linux, GNU/Free
Software, EMS (Emergency Medical Services), Ham/Amateur Radio, and other
content. It might not be updated very often, but I plan on putting on
somewhat interesting, informative content.
