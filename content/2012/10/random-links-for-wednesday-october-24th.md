Some random interesting links from Slashdot for today:

-   [The Greatest Battle of the Personal Computing Revolution Lies Ahead
    - Slashdot][]. A bit of a rant, but makes some good points that are
    close to my heart, and unfortunately far from the thoughts of many
    non-techies.
-   [Terms of Service; Didn't Read][] - an interesting project
-   [How Patent Trolls Harm the Economy - Slashdot][] - another issue
    close to my heart
-   [How Google Cools Its Armada of Servers » Data Center Knowledge][]
-   [Data centers – Google Data centers][] - A photo tour of Google data
    centers, by Google, along with a [Google+ post][] about the
    architecture photographer who did this work.
-   [DARPA Funds a $300 Software-Defined Radio For Hackers - Slashdot][]
    - way cool.
-   [Honeynet Map][] - "realtime" map of cybersecurity incidents, from
    the Honeynet Project.
-   [Malware Is 'Rampant' On Medical Devices In Hospitals - Slashdot][]
    - a bit scary, but unfortunately not that hard to guess. I've seen
    (probably unpatched) Windows 2000 workstations on hospital networks.
-   To top off the scary posts: [Researcher Reverse-Engineers Pacemaker
    Transmitter To Deliver Deadly Shocks - Slashdot][]
