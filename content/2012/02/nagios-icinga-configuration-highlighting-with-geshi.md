As you may know from former posts, this blog
([WordPress](http://wordpress.org)-powered) and a few
[MediaWiki](http://www.mediawiki.org) sites that I have use the
excellent PHP-based [GeSHi](http://qbnz.com/highlighter/) syntax
highlighter. Today I was writing [a
post](/2012/02/sending-aim-messages-from-a-perl-script/) that includes
some Icinga (Nagios) configuration snippets. After a quick search, I
found a [Nagios language file for
GeSHi](https://github.com/adepertat/geshi-nagios) on GitHub. Thanks very
much to [Alb√©ric de Pertat (adepertat)](https://github.com/adepertat)
for writing this and providing it to the public.
