Since I always seem to forget this wonderful feature of [GNU
screen](http://www.gnu.org/software/screen/) (probably one of the pieces
of software I use the most every day)...

-   To split the current region horizontally into two equal regions:
    `C-a S`
-   To switch between those regions: `C-a Tab`
-   To close all regions but the current one: `C-a Q`

This is absolutely invaluable for watching logs on multiple machines at
once.
