A while back, I did a technical phone screen with a big online "social"
company (I won't say who, but they're a household name, growing fast,
and doing cool things; that doesn't leave *too* many options). I rarely
remember to write down interview questions, but I was cleaning out my
desk this morning and came by a ripped-out sheet of notebook paper with
a handful of the interview questions written on it. Most of them weren't
terribly difficult, or terribly unusual for competent technical
interviewers, but since I happen to actually have the list written down,
I though I'd share it. I don't remember why the programming questions
are all Python; likely, I was asked to choose between Python (which I've
used, though not lately), Ruby (which I can barely muddle my way through
reading on a good day), and something else I don't know. Here are some
of them...

-   What is an inode? What does it store?
-   What is a hard link?
-   What is the difference between a hard link and a soft link?
-   What is a list in Python?
-   Name some data structures that you'd use in Python. Describe them,
    and tell me why you would use them.
-   How would you list all the man pages containing the keyword "date"?
-   If the `chmod` binary had its permissions set to `000`, how would
    you fix it?
