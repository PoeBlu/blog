Here is a small selection of sysadmin links that I recently found, and
wanted to share:

-   [Blameless PostMortems and a Just Culture « Code as Craft][] - some
    really good ideas about a culture that recognizes and seeks to
    remedy human errors, rather than punishing and generating fear.
-   [The first pillar: We alert on what we draw - Agile Sysadmin][]
-   [Puppet SSL explained - Masterzen's Blog][]
-   [Unix Orchestration Roundup: Tools for Programmatic Systems
    Administration][]
