Today is my last day in my almost-year-long stint as a System
Administrator at [TechTarget][]. Monday, I start a new contract-to-perm
position as a Linux Engineer with [Cox Media Group Digital &
Strategy][]. I can't say a whole lot about the new job, other than it
will hopefully be a great change for me, and they make heavy use of
[Django][]. If you want to get a bit of an idea of what they're about,
here's a [document on their departmental ethos][]. Hopefully I'll be
able to post more useful information here, and post more often, in the
future. I'm really psyched about the new gig.
