In a follow-up to my [Some Thoughts on Choosing a New Wordpress Theme][]
post from a few days ago, I decided on the [Admired][] [theme][] by
[Brad Thomas][]. It's amazingly full-featured and has a good set of
options. I had to manually change a few things in the CSS (I wanted to
tweak the top bar colors a bit in a way that's not supported in the
options), but overall it was a very simple transition. While it's
unfortunately very far from valid [HTML][] or [CSS][], it seems quite
nice.

If you happen to read this post and see anything wrong with the theme,
or it doesn't display properly for you, please leave a comment below
(with browser version and OS, if you please).

My next project, continuing on from my [Inaccuracies in Google Analytics
for Website Stats][] post, is to compare the two self-hosted
JavaScript-based open source Google Analytics alternatives I've
identified ([Piwik][] and [Open Web Analytics][]) and try one out on my
site (keeping in mind that my server is pretty heavily loaded, and I
don't want to push it over the edge). Once I come to some sort of
conclusion on that, I'll get back to some useful posts.
