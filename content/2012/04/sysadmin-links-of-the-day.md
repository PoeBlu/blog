A few links that I've had in my "mention in a blog post" category for a
while:

-   [Summary of Windows Azure Service Disruption on Feb 29th, 2012 -
    Windows Azure - Site Home - MSDN
    Blogs](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/windowsazure/archive/2012/03/09/summary-of-windows-azure-service-disruption-on-feb-29th-2012.aspx)
    - a *very* detailed and interesting post on what caused the Windows
    Azure cloud outage on February 29th, 2012. IMHO many of these
    failures were predictable, and the bulk of the outage was caused by
    a combination of inputs not being checked for validity in code, or
    the invalid case not being handled properly.
