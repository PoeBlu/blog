I just read a wondeful blog post by Adam Fletcher, [What Does A Sysadmin
Look Like In 10
Years?](http://www.thesimplelogic.com/2011/03/22/what-does-a-sysadmin-look-like-in-10-years/).
This almost totally describes what I see as the future of system
administors/engineers/architects, and DevOps. And what I try, or want,
to do. It's the most accurate and succinct description I've ever read.
