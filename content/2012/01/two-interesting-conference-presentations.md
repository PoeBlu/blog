Two interesting presentations - which, unfortunately, I only heard the
audio for (they came up in my podcast playlist during my commute today).

For the non-techie-geeks out there, [All Your Brains Suck - Known Bugs
And Exploits In Wetware: OSCON 2011 - O'Reilly Conferences, July 25 -
29, 2011, Portland, OR][] is an interesting talk from Paul Fenwick. Yes,
it's from a techie conference ([wetware][] == the brain), but it's
mostly psychology-based, and covers some REALLY interesting things about
how the human brain works, especially with an emphasis on how the brain
is manipulated in advertising and otherwise.

For the techie-geeks among us (well, given the other link, "geeks" would
be too vague), [Velocity 2011: Theo Schlossnagle, "Career
Development"][]. It's a bit of a rant, but a good talk for us
infrastructure/ops people, and developers as well, and covers some
thoughts on both careers and how we should do out jobs.
