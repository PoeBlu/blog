Well, good news about SOPA. All of my sites participated in the [SOPA
Strike][]. While I didn't fully black everything out (I guess I wasn't
keeping up enough on what others were doing...), I displayed a
full-screen popover with a message (I have a version of my homepage with
the popover enabled [here][]). I actually spent a few hours trying to
come up with a safe, effective, cross-browser way to do it with one line
of javascript put in all of my pages (everything from static HTML to
[WordPress][] and [redmine][]), but ended up giving up and including a
few javascript files and a stylesheet too. At some point, I'll try and
post the info on how I did it.

Anyway, I just wanted to share a *really* cool SOPA protest blackout
page that I saw:

it...
