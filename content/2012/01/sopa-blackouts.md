Well, good news about SOPA. All of my sites participated in the [SOPA
Strike](http://sopastrike.com/). While I didn't fully black everything
out (I guess I wasn't keeping up enough on what others were doing...), I
displayed a full-screen popover with a message (I have a version of my
homepage with the popover enabled
[here](http://www.jasonantman.com/sopa.php)). I actually spent a few
hours trying to come up with a safe, effective, cross-browser way to do
it with one line of javascript put in all of my pages (everything from
static HTML to [WordPress](http://wordpress.org/) and
[redmine](http://www.redmine.org/)), but ended up giving up and
including a few javascript files and a stylesheet too. At some point,
I'll try and post the info on how I did it.

Anyway, I just wanted to share a *really* cool SOPA protest blackout
page that I saw:
[http://www.zachstronaut.com/lab/text-shadow-box/stop-sopa.html](http://www.zachstronaut.com/lab/text-shadow-box/stop-sopa.html),
by Zachary Johnson. Of course, apparently, I'm not the only person who
saw it...
