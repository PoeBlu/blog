Just a quick little tip, I happened by the [Mobile
Barcoder](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/mobile-barcoder/)
Firefox add-on the other day. It's a Firefox add-on that generates [QR
Code](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qr_code) barcodes for text or links,
right in your browser. While my Droid3 has a full keyboard, sometimes I
still want to quickly send links from my desktop browser session to my
phone. Firefox Sync helps a lot but is a bit slow on the phone (since I
usually have 100+ tabs open between all of my desktop Firefox sessions),
and email is an option but a bit slower.

There are two caveats about this add-on though:

1.  The feature to generate a QR code for the URL of the current page
    shows up in the status bar, which isn't shown in modern versions of
    Firefox. You'll need to enable the [Add-on
    bar](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/what-add-bar).
2.  It uses the
    [http://mobilecodes.nokia.com/](http://mobilecodes.nokia.com/)
    server to generate barcodes, so it's dependent on connectivity and
    that service.
