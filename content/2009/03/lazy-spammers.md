This is by no means rare, but I happened to be checking through my spam
folder before deleting the contents (I used to just do this once a week
or so, but apparently since jasonantman.com is up and running correctly
and listening on port 25, the volume has increased a bit) and came by
this email:

    Subject:
    Dear $TO_EMAIL 17.3.2009 84% 0FF
    From: Best Price <$TO_EMAIL>
    Date: Tue, 17 Mar 2009 16:45:54 -0400 (EDT)
    To: <$TO_EMAIL>

Wow. I know that spammers aren't exactly world-class programmers, but
this seems like something that anyone who's been in CS101 would realize
is wrong....

On the positive side, maybe I should just add a SpamAssassin rule to
trigger for anything with "$TO\_EMAIL" in the headers. Not that I'd need
it in this case, as the message had a score of 21.7 and my threshold is
5.0....
