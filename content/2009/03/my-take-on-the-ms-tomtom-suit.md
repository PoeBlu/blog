To keep it short, I'm sure anyone who winds up here has already heard
about the recent Microsoft lawsuit against TomTom, alleging patent
infringement. Coverage has been extensive, including
[GrokLaw](http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20090226070041454)
and [Linux Magazine](http://www.linux-mag.com/id/7258). While the
mentioned patents include car navigation technology (at least the names
of the patents seem amazingly vague) and FAT . Most of the news stories
I've read say that it's "good for Linux" and will never see the inside
of a courtroom.

Maybe I'm just a pessimist, but I see the idea behind this as much worse
than "good for Linux". MS chose one company to sue. TomTom just happens
to be not only a household name, but also posted a $1.2 Billion loss
last year. It seems to me this is more of a FUD campaign than anything
else... the best case for Microsoft is that they could strangle TomTom
in a legal battle, perhaps force them to go under, and then ensure a
media spin along the lines of "Know that company that made the GPS in
every car? They used Linux in it, they got sued by Microsoft, and
they're no more."

While I haven't always been a fan of TomTom - and am still bothered by
the fact that my (stolen, no longer in my possession) TomTom One ran
Linux but wouldn't give me a console or even let me see the filesystem -
I'll be watching this closely, and hoping that the powers that be will
not let the angry dinosaur crush a company over a series of patents that
are either horribly obvious (anyone other than Garmin having a claim to
any GPS-related idea is beyond me) or just horrible (FAT?!?!?!).

On a final note - isn't it about time that the US finally dealt with
this damn software patent thing? Not only does it horribly stifle
innovation (not good to do in a bad economy), and I have a hard time
grasping the claim that Microsoft's developers are so all-powerful that
they're the only people that thought of technology X, but it's about
time that the US government got the balls to look Microsoft in the eyes
and say, "you're not the only game in town anymore. Get used to it."
