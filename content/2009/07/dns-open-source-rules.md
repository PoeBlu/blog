DNS is arguably one of the most important services on the Internet.
Without it, every domain name and email address we know would be
meaningless. We'd be thrown back into the days of IP addresses without
corresponding names. And, given everything that depends on DNS, it's
also one of the most important services from a security standpoint.
Compromised DNS servers could cause end-of-the-world havoc for whatever
zones they control.

So here's a fact that Microsoft and the other proprietary guys don't
want you to know: **58.65% of DNS servers that are listed as being
authoritative for .com or .net domains are running the free/open source
[ISC BIND](https://www.isc.org/software/BIND/). Less than 0.3% are using
a Microsoft product**. To me, that says something.

This is according to the October 2008 [measurement factory DNS server
survey](http://dns.measurement-factory.com/surveys/200810.html) of 99+
Million addresses (618,000+ hosts).
