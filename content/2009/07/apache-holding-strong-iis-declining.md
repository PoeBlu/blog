According to the latest (June 2009) [NetCraft web server survey][], the
Free/Open Source [Apache web server][] is now hosting 50.46% of all
active web sites surveyed (about 38 Million). Microsoft's IIS server is
at 28.05% (or about 29 Million) - a 7.64% decline from IIS's May 2009
statistics. Interestingly, Google holds 12.2%, presumably most of that
is their own content or content generated by their applications.

This is nothing new - both Free/Open Source software and Unix-related
stuff has always had a stronger share in the server (and Internet)
market than Microsoft products. And, despite all of Microsoft's [FUD][],
it's clear that Apache is still more popular than IIS by a large margin
- probably in no small part due to the extendability and scalability of
Apache, and its security record (just take a look at the difference in
[system calls][]).

The real shining example, however, comes from looking at the stats on
the Internet's million busiest sites - 66.26% running Apache and only
18.77% running IIS, which has been constant for the better part of the
last year. That says quite a bit about the stability and scalability of
Apache. Not to mention that a lot of the really big sites run their own
custom-modified versions of Apache which may or may not be identified as
Apache in a survey.
