It's been a while since I've posted any meaningful updates here. And
it's not for lack of work - actually, I have a page-long list of
projects I've finished and things I've discovered that I want to share
with... well... whoever finds me on Google. I've got some new code that
needs attention - lots of tiny little make-life-easier scripts and some
not-so-tiny stuff - as well as a few interesting things I've found, and
some projects that deserve updates.

So, over the next week, I'm going to try and make it my purpose to start
posting updates and shortening the list of things to mention. However,
I've also decided to set aside a few minutes at the end of each day to
post whatever I did/found that's interesting, or add some updates on
ongoing projects. Perhaps also have a weekly writing hour (probably on
the weekend) to post larger updates.

It's also worth note that, for the most part, I never started a blog in
the hopes of having subscribers. I simply think of this as a place to
post some useful things that I do or figure out, in the hopes that other
people will stumble by and also find them useful.

So, what have I been up to lately? Let's start with the past two days:

-   Trying to get [FreeRADIUS][] to authenticate with groupOfNames
    objects in [OpenLDAP][], the intended end result being centralized
    authentication for [m0n0wall][]'s captive portal.
-   At work, designing a system to test the client-visible functionality
    of a *large* captive portal system (on the order of 700 AP's and 50k
    users) - essentially, sitting on a client VLAN and checking DHCP,
    DNS, HTTP redirects, and the validity of the login page.
-   Security auditing of everything at home, and trying to find a
    working [Nessus][] web interface.
-   Continuing on my move over to static IP - specifically starting to
    roll out HTTPS for some internal stuff.
-   Trying to get [Vyatta][]'s VPN to work with a dynamically-IPed
    m0n0wall endpoint (in network-to-network).
-   Some cabling upgrades at home and at [the ambulance corps][].
-   Slowly but surely trying to make major changes and release a new
    version of [PHP EMS Tools][].
-   Get [Bacula][] working better.
-   Load test this web server, and decide if it's time for new hardware.
-   Some new stuff for my truck.
-   Get rid of [MediaWiki][] as my [homepage][] and replace it with a
    CMS.
-   Continue my move to SubVersion and setup ViewVC for it.
-   Rewrite my resume and start looking for jobs, as I'm finishing
    classes in July.
-   Try to get some sleep and keep my sanity.
