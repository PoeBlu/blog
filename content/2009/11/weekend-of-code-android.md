The Droid is here (literally, sitting in my pocket), and I have the next
two days off of work - plus the weekend. Minus personal commitments,
that's about two full (call it 16 hour) days to get some work done.
While I have lots of things that could use my attention - a number of
neglected projects, my big new PHPsa project, and some server
consolidation at home - I've decided to dedicate the time to Android
development.

I've got the ADK installed and running, and the emulator is wonderful
(especially with the Droid skin). And I know it's wrong, but I think I'm
going to be developing the first app for Android 2.0 (especially given
the new [ContactsContract][] API in 5).

I'm having a few issues with [Subclipse][], even on the latest OpenSuSE
11.1, and still have a few things I want to do on the phone... but
hopefully I'll have a beta build of the app by the end of the weekend.
I've already done most of the data modeling and sketched out the
storyboard.

I'm not going to say much about what the app is until it's ready, but
it's something targeted at people like me - SysAdmins with way too many
things on their plate for their number of waking hours.
