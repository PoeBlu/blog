A friend recently showed me the syllabus for one of her classes, which
is partially given online through the [Sakai course management
system][]. At the bottom was a section on course policies which stated,
in part, that the "Academic Integrity policy is in full effect".
Apparently, this professor is giving online exams in Sakai. The policy
goes on to state that not only is collaborative test-taking not allowed,
but also that use of any resources (including a textbook) is not
allowed. The policy states that use of electronic resources ("a second
web browser") is also not allowed, and that the course management system
includes "features" to prevent "cheating" - enumerated as a time stamp
for every answer.

To me at least, this shows not only an unrealistic outlook, but also a
horrible lack of understanding about technology.

1.  Does this professor actually expect that he can have students taken
    an exam at home, on a computer, and none of them will Google an
    answer? If so, he should take some steps to actually prevent such
    actions - like having the students take the exam in a proctored
    environment. If not, what is the purpose of this intimidation?
2.  I know I'm not a programming wizard, but if someone can tell me the
    algorithm to determine whether or not a student is cheating - *based
    solely on their answers and the submission time of each answer* -
    I'd really like to be enlightened.

If professors want to administer exams online and prevent students from
using *any* outside resources, it seems to me like the only way to
realistically do this is to setup a human-proctored computer lab
(perhaps University-wide at a number of locations, available for members
of any class) that allows access only to HTTP/HTTPS for the course
management system and nothing else. All the human proctor would have to
do is sit in the room and make sure students aren't looking in textbooks
or conferring with each other.
