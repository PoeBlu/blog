As mentioned in my [Custom Truck Console][] post, since my truck was
stolen and now recovered (with all of the emergency equipment stripped
out - weird) I've got to start from scratch. Since I finished the
console, I've started work on redoing the lighting. The first grueling
step was to check continuity of the existing wiring (what was left of
it), strip out everything that didn't work, and rehab what did. Then I
did a few pulls, mainly a giant pull from the console to under the hood
of six 16-ga wires and three 12-ga, along with a massive run of 6-ga
welding cable direct from the battery (with a circuit breaker) to the
console.

There's a thread covering this install over at [elightbars.org][] as
well as a thread on the [previous (original) installation][].

This is part 1 of (hopefully only) 2. The list of what's installed so
far is:

-   Custom console.
-   [Galls SE082][] switch box - 3-position slider, 5 on/off rocker
    switches and one on-off-(on) rocker switch.
-   Radio Shack [Pro-433][] scanner, hopefully to be replaced by a [Icom
    F5061][].
-   B/B Whelen Dual Avenger above rearview mirror.
-   Unitrol 80K air horn (siren wires not connected)
-   2x [Sirennet 100W speakers][] mounted in front bumper.
-   2x B/B Whelen LIN4's on [10-75 Lighting][] front license plate
    bracket.
