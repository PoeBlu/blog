While some people whom I greatly admire have [stronger feelings][] than
I on the subject, and many others, I felt the need to share some
thoughts on DRM this morning.

Here at Rutgers, we had been promoting [Ruckus][] for music downloading.
The idea was that if you go to Rutgers, you get to use their service for
free and download your music. I've never used it. Even if their software
had *worked* with Linux, it's still so badly DRM'ed that I couldn't even
burn the music to a CD. Being an old-fashioned person who has a regular
old non-MP3 cd player in my truck, what good would that do me?

So, today Ruckus just shows this:

I'll admit it, I'm not the least bit sad to see it go. And not just
because it was Windows-only at a time when Linux is gaining in
popularity and MacOS is all-out exploding. What was my real problem with
it? The DRM. What good is a bunch of 1's and 0's if I can't use it the
way I like? You couldn't burn Ruckus music to CD, and I doubt you could
use it on my ancient Sansa 512MB MP3 player either, as it doesn't
support DRM (and runs Linux).

So what's my final thought? From [TechCrunch.com][]:

If DRM wasn't bad enough to begin with, the music you already have will
just **stop working**... because the original distributor isn't there
anymore to tell it to work.
