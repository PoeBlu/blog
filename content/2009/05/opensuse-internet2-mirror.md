I just bought a "new" desktop - I was thinking of doing an insane AMD
Phenom II x4 940 (quad-core 3.0GHz) box - but I happened to find a used
machine from $WORK; a Dell Precision 470 workstation, dual Xeon Nocona
2.8GHz processors, 4GB RAM (takes up to 16GB). So, I need a DVD of my
usual desktop distro ([OpenSuSE](http://www.opensuse.org)) for x64.
Being that I'm at work ([Rutgers Unviersity](http://www.rutgers.edu)), I
figured the quickest thing would be to find an
[Internet2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet2) mirror, as Rutgers
has 400Gbps peering on NJedgeNet.

Unfortunately, the [OpenSuSE Mirror
List](http://mirrors.opensuse.org/list/11.1.html) doesn't mention which
sites have I2 peering. Luckily, the first logical one I tried - the
Harvard mirror - was showing an I2/MAGIPE route via traceroute.

If anyone else needs an I2 mirror of OpenSuSE,
[http://mirrors.med.harvard.edu/opensuse/](http://mirrors.med.harvard.edu/opensuse/)
seems to do it. My desktop was getting a sustained +/- 160 Mbps transfer
rate, and I got the entire 4.3GB DVD image in under 2-1/2 minutes.
