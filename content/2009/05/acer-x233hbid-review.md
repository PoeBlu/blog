I just bought myself a new monitor for my [MythTV][] box, as I've moved
my beautiful Acer AL2416W 24"er to my new desktop. The chosen monitor,
based on price, reviews and features, is the Acer X233Hbid. It's a 23"
16:9 (not 16:10) monitor that runs at 1920x1080, provides true 1080p,
and has an HDMI input (not that I'd ever use a [restricted][]
connection). After a few minutes of having it turned on and running, the
picture quality is quite nice, even with quite a bit of glare.

However, I have two major complaints within the first ten minutes of
unboxing it:

1.  **No real manual, nor an online copy**. The monitor comes only with
    a Quick Start Guide. There's no printed full manual. More
    distressingly, it isn't even listed in their list of monitor models
    on their Support site. There's no manual copy online either. There
    was a CD provided with the user's manual on it. However, for a
    company that sells netbooks with no CD drive, this seems like quite
    a bad decision. But why, you ask, would I need a manual for my
    monitor?
2.  **No VESA mounting instructions** One of my main criteria in
    choosing a monitor was that it allow [VESA][] mounting, as I have my
    MythTV monitor on a monitor arm (easily adjustable angle so others
    in the room can see). The Acer X233Hbid has a 100x100mm VESA
    mounting space on the back. However, in a rare design mistake
    (unlike my 24" Acer AL2416W), the monitor stand is two parts - one
    rectangular column about 4" long attached to the back of the
    monitor, and a base with a column which mates with the one on the
    back of the monitor. Unfortunately, the column part on the back of
    the monitor came pre-attached, and there was no mention in the
    manual of VESA mounting or how to remove the column.

**Column removal:** The part of the monitor base which ships attached to
the monitor is a fairly easy removal. Though I was originally worried
about breaking something on my beautiful new screen, I found two plastic
pieces on either side of the pre-attached part of the base which
appeared to be snap-in trim pieces. Prying them off with a screwdriver
revealed four screws which hold this piece to the monitor. Not only was
removal easy, but the trim pieces snapped back into place for a nice
clean look.
