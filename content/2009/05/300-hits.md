I know I've been letting my blog die off a bit lately, mainly due to the
giant amount of work I've been doing. I plan on updating a lot more over
the next few weeks.

I happened to get a comment on one of my
[posts](/2009/02/routhost-dns-problems-godaddy-and-security-through-obscurity/)
today, so I decided to take a peek at webalizer and see how things are
doing. Apparently, I'm getting 300+ hits/day, including a quite nice
array of search queries. Unfortunately, due to the way I redid my
logging infrastructure, I don't have any historical data (and it seems
like the webalizer history is still broken, as I'm only seeing data for
this month). But cool!
