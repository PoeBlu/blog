I usually try not to rant about non-technical stuff here, but this was on my mind.

Modern American society is perpetuating the notion that the goal for everyone, period,
is to become an educated professional. Even disregarding the fact that a functioning
society relies on many, many people who don't sit at a desk all day, this just isn't
fair. It's not fair to the people who don't *want* to be stuck behind a keyboard all day.
It's not fair to the people who don't have the skills to do so, but are led to believe
that they'll be more "successful" if they pile up tens of thousands of dollars of debt
going to college - and doing their best to work a menial job while they do so - instead
of considering other career options (or, just not getting a degree). It seems wrong that,
with as much as our society relies on trades, "unskilled" (which really is a horrible misnomer)
labor, and other careers that *shouldn't* require a college degree, we constantly reinforce
the notion that college is a requirement for life. Our tax dollars subsidize scholarships
and grants for anyone to go to college, but do virtually nothing for someone who wants to
learn a craft or trade. Even worse, this notion perpetuates the idea that anything other
than a college-educated office worker or professional is "wrong" or "lacking" to the
extent that the true craftsman who takes great pride in their work is becoming increasingly
rare.

On another note, the news is pervaded with stories of crime, gang violence, and social
unrest - to a point which I really believe is unheard of in modern history. Sure, you
could blame a lot of this on politics, population explosion, the economy, etc. But here's
one viewpoint that I haven't heard before: the need for thrill, excitement and adventure.
In times past, there were legitimate, socially acceptable outlets for this. Young (well,
men at the time, but let's say "people" in the modern age) full of wanderlust and yearning
for adventure had occupations that could support this - Going West, enlisting on the crew
of a ship, or joining the military; sure, they were horribly (often fatally) romanticized,
but they did offer excitement, adventure, and the ability to see exotic places otherwise
unknown.
