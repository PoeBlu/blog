Summary: People are equal
Status: draft

I wanted to write a well-thought-out, coherent, moving call to action. I haven't.
I'm a grown man sitting at his desk crying because of words said to another human
being on the Internet. I'm not the least bit ashamed to admit that. And if the events
of the past hours, days, weeks, months, years don't make your stomach turn, I think you
really need to dig deep into who you are as a person. (As an aside, perhaps I shouldn't
have published this yet, because it's very stream-of-consciousness. It's very likely
that I mis-worded something, or that my words don't convey my actual intent. Apologies
if it comes across that way.)

I am a twenty-something-year-old white male. I'm married. I'm speaking from a place of
privilege. Not because of what I've done technically, but simply because of the life
that I was born into. I like to think that I earned my job, that I've earned whatever
recoginition I've gotten from my colleagues. But the reality is, I didn't. None of us
(white males in tech) have. It was given to us because of who we are. We can only truly
say that we've earned what we have if another human being, regardless of race, gender,
sexual orientation, or any other facet of their being, would get the same recognition
for the same work.

We've built a set of tools that we thought would be the great equalizer, a driving force
of democracy and free speech, something to break down barriers, and protect the innocent
and oppressed. Yet it's being used for a great evil. Some of those who self-identify as
technical people, whether gamers or coders or whatever, have __become__ the evil, the
oppressors, the tyrants that so many of us want to rid the world of. The technology and
anonymity that so many of us thought are forces of equality are, in fact, being used
for exactly the opposite.

My words come on the heels of so much hate. What I [read this morning](http://wehuntedthemammoth.com/2014/10/11/yet-another-woman-in-gaming-has-been-driven-from-her-home-by-death-threats/)
(trigger warning for all sorts of awful things) is simply the latest example of the
true depravity of some "people." Seriously. If you're comfortable with reading threats
of rape and murder, read that. Consider what a person could possibly have done to actually
deserve that level of hate. If you're a religious person, the answer should be "nothing."
Hey, guess what, if you're a __human being__, the answer should be "nothing." Just read
some of those comments. Who were they made to? A black woman in the deep south in 1950?
A Jew in Poland in 1940? No. A respected professional, in 2014, who happens to be a woman.
And yet, comments like these aren't coming from some openly recognized evil like the klan
or a real, uniform-wearing nazi. They're coming from supposedly-professional men. Who knows,
it might be the guy at the desk next to you, or the maintainer of some project you love.
If these things were said face-to-face, let alone in a workplace, someone would (hopefully)
have to pay for it.

I got my start in tech at a public university. I worked there for five years. I was in a bit
of a bubble, and while I followed the __technical__ side of the tech world, I was unaware
of most of the non-technical parts of it (granted, this was pre-Twitter, and I wasn't too
involved in what passed for social media at the time). Harassment was a big deal. The only
occurrence of it that I ever heard of in my workplace was by a man, against another man.
There were plenty of women where I worked (statistically, probably a LOT), and I never
once heard gender come up as more than a way to put a username to a face. I was naive.
It's only in the past two years, when I both became more involved in what's going on
in "our industry", and started working for a larger company, that I became aware that
the tech industry isn't what I always thought it was - a bunch of idealistic, liberal,
totally open and accepting people who were completely indifferent to anything about
another person other than their code.

What I found was something very different. A hotbed of hypocracy. An industry that
I thought was about merit (opportunity to earn that merit is a totally different
rant...) for anyone isn't. It's fraught with bias. And I don't believe that any
of us are truly blameless. Sure, I know, I'm a flaming liberal and always have been.
But I take the idea that all people are created equal very seriously. My ancestors
have lived in America since the 1640's. And they might not have seen freedom the
way I do in this day and age, but I'm damn confident that they didn't give their
lives to secure the freedom for women to be threatened with rape and death.
I shudder to think about the reality of the people who say such things. Are there
actual living people at the end of those twitter accounts? Do they work somewhere,
get paid, supposedly contribute to this industry? Could one of them be sitting next
to me in my office? I'm not a woman. I do feel uncomfortable and unsafe sitting
in the same office as anyone who thinks it's totally acceptable to threaten
another person with sexual assault and death.

How does our industry allow this? How does our legal system allow this? I've never
been for suppression of free speech. I've never been in favor of tighter controls
on Internet use, or less privacy. But "making terroristic threats" is an actual
crime. Threatening someone with death - without even going as far as saying "I know
where you live, at this address, and I'm going to kill you" - is __not__ legal.
Nevermind the terrifyingly deep moral issues. How do companies employ these
people? How does the mainstream media not see this and make it a real thing?
How is __any__ human being actually OK with things like that. This isn't even
about facts. I don't believe any of these unsubstantiated accusations are true,
but even if they were - sleeping with people for promotions, trying to limit
hate speech against you, whatever other horrible things - none of it could
justify rape and death threats. Period. End of story. When things enter the
realm of specific threats of physical harm, there is nothing someone could
do to deserve that.

Would the people who are doing this do the same thing if their target was
a successful, upstanding black man? Indian? What if it was another white
man who was gay? Are these people married, or have female family members?
Do they kill them for being women? Do they refuse to be operated on by
a female surgeon? Refuse a life-saving treatment developed by a female
chemist? Or is this simply a matter of, "women are great as long as they
stay out of __my__ world; those women deserve death and suffering."

Yes, I'm going to put a call to action in here. This is a problem that must
be addressed by not only our legal system, and not only all human beings, but
by our industry. Standing by and watching is not an option. Condemning people
on Twitter is not the solution. It's very clear - certainly to anyone who's
been involved in online communities - that a community sets its standards.
The community defines what is acceptable behavior. Sure, there are different
levels of hate, and I'm not sure what the best way is to deal with the more
insidious, less obvious kinds. But people who make death and rape threats,
people who threaten the life or well-being of another human being for
simply not looking the same - that is not accepable. Period. And I say
this now, publicly, in front of all of my colleagues and potential future
employers: I will not support someone like that. I will not work with or
for them. If I find out that one of my co-workers is doing something like
this, I __will__ contact the authorities, I __will__ contact my management
and HR and anyone else who will listen. I will not hire them, because they
are a serious liability to the company. They are criminals. Granted, I'm
sure that relatively few, if any, of them actually think that they're
right and justified enough to say these things with their own name
attached.

I can only hope that my impression is correct, and that people like this
are a horribly vocal minority. Well, the rest of us have an ethical and
moral obligation. We are in a position of privilege. We can get new jobs
and we know it. This very culture of inequality secures the position
of those lucky enough to be born with the right DNA. Sitting back and
watching is not a solution. Condeming the actions of these inhuman
few is not enough. We, the men of tech who actually care about our
beliefs, who respect other human beings, who claim to stand for what
is right, need to act. We need to let it be known that __we__ are
the majority, and that such actions are simply not welcome. We
have an obligation to use our privilege to help those who lack
it. And to be decisive in our actions. Sure, this isn't __the solution__.
But people who attack others for who they are don't belong in tech,
they belong in jail. And theatening another human being with death
should carry a very clear, immediate penalty: you will not work in
this industry. If someone will hire you, nobody will work with you.
