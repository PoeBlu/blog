Summary: My blog is finally migrated from self-hosted WordPress to Pelican on GitHub Pages. Quite an ordeal.
Status: draft

I just finally finished my migration from self-hosted WordPress to [Pelican](http://getpelican.com), a Python-based
static site generator, hosted on [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/). It's not only easier and free, but also the
first step in my plan to migrate off of my [Linode](http://linode.com) VM and onto a mix of EC2 and free services.

I'm sure this post will be [around in five years](/2009/02/wordpress-installation-finished/) when there's a smarter way
to do all this, but until then... yay!

I hit a number of bumps during the migration, mainly around [Migrating HTML posts from WordPress to Markdown in Pelican](/2014/02/converting-wordpress-posts-to-pelican-markdown/)
and migrating [WordPress comments to Disqus](/2014/03/wordpress-to-pelican-with-disqus-comments/), but in the end everything
seems to be working. Hopefully someone will find this and save a few hours or days of work if they try the same thing.
