Summary: A few thoughts on harassment in tech.
Status: draft

I almost always (at least in the past few years) keep this blog about technical
stuff only, facts and useful information. Sure, the bounce rate is enormous, but
I really do this more as "notes that might also be useful to others" and sharing
my work than trying to attract and retain followers. This post is a digression
from that, but I feel that it's an extremely important one.

The tech news has been abuzz lately with more and more women in tech taking their
stories of sexual harassment and sexism public. Adria Richards' [ordeal at PyCon last year](http://butyoureagirl.com/2013/03/18/forking-and-dongle-jokes-dont-belong-at-tech-conferences/)
was probably the first one that caught my attention - I don't know if that's because
I was working at a Python shop and had a few colleagues at the conferences, or because
I'd just started doing the [twitter](https://twitter.com/j_antman) thing and before that
stuck mainly to dry tech-only news sources. Whatever the reason (see [aside](#aside) below),
I really wasn't aware of the issues at all until recently. I am, however, deeply
disturbed by them.

When I read some of the first buzz about Adria's incident - news spread pretty much
immediately through my office and the people I follow on Twitter - I thought it was
horribly blown out of proportion. I'm honestly still a bit unclear on the exact details.
But I can say that there's a clear moment in the narrative where I think the problem
happened. I've made jokes of poor taste like that before. I'm sure that in my youth,
I made them in front of people who didn't appreciate it. And maybe in my not-so-youth.
On one hand, I'm a staunch advocate of free speech. I put up with a lot growing up with
a Jewish parent in a town that was - quite literally - 98%+ white Christian. Could I see
myself sitting in a conference and making a "forking" joke to a close friend? Sure.
But I'm also quite cognizant that the next thought I'd have would be, "oh s\*\*t,
this is *not* the place for that, I hope nobody heard it." And there's the problem -
the lack of understanding that, "oh, I just did something wrong. And I need to stop now."

Last october [Justine Arreche](https://twitter.com/SaltineJustine) stepped forward and
[described an event at a post-conference drinkup](http://archive.is/20131012091136/blogjustine.wordpress.com/2013/10/12/because-it-needs-to-be-said/).
I was ... astounded. There are lots of ways to describe it, but let's be blunt. She was
sexually assaulted by a coworker, in front
of other coworkers and professionals. I suppose I'm just naive and sheltered, but I
simply couldn't conceive of such a thing happening. I applaud her bravery in stepping
forward. I can't say how much it disturbs me that it seems that incidents like these -
running the gamut from the wrong jokes at the wrong time to outright
