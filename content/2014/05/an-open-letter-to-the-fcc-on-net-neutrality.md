I have worked in computer and Internet-related roles for my whole professional life, currently at a large media company.
Without Net Neutrality, innovation on the Internet will be forever stifled. I speak not only of the innovation of independent
inventors and startups that have made so much of what we now call the Internet, but also of the innovation and self-reliance
so core to the American dream and way of life. We live in a country founded not by monopolistic conglomerates but by
individuals, entrepreneurs, and small businesses. A pay-to-play Internet simultaneously lines the pockets of big business
while greatly raising the barrier to entry for innovators, small businesses, and citizens seeking freedom of speech
and expression.
