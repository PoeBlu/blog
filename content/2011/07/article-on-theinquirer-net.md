I guess it's pretty strange that I just found out about it now, three
years later, but there's an [article on
TheInquirer.net](http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/1026958/citibank-infuriating-customers-linux-hostile-site)
about Citibank's website not allowing Linux, that heavily quotes [a blog
post of mine](/2008/08/linux-choice-updates-citibank-issues/) about the
issue. Cool.
