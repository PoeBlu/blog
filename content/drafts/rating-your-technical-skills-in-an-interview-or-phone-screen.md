__Disclaimer:__ What follows are sweeping generalizations based on
my time on both sides of the interview table. There are certainly exceptions,
so don't take this as an authoritative guide. Also do what research you can on
the company you're interviewing with; it will help you, and it always makes
an interviewer happy to know that a candidate took the time to find out about
the company (and maybe even the team or people they're interviewing with). If
you happen to be interviewed by me, use what you read here. I will have
Googled you before the interview, it's fine if you do the same.

I should also say that my typical panel interview is 90 minutes with the team
you'll actually be working with; this isn't a Google or Microsoft two-day
interview shop.

I've been doing a lot of interviewing lately (at least for smaller
companies - 20-30 engineering candidates in the last two years).
And there are a few areas that are glaring, recurrent problems with
so many candidates.

- answer the question. don't spend more than 1-3 minutes on an answer unless
  the question asks for it, or unless prompted. on the other hand, unless the
  question is very obviously yes/no, don't ever
  give a one word answer. If I ask if you know X and you say, "yes", I'll
  either assume you don't have the skills to back it up, or don't care. Give
  me a sentence or two, like "yes, at my last job", and offer to extrapolate
  if the interviewer(s) want.

Know how your skills compare to others

comparing to your interviewers, every other candidate for a similar job. not
necessarily people you've worked with before. 

- external recruiters/headhunters
- internal recruiters - gray area
- technical people (your interview panel)

When I interview someone, I use a trick that I picked up when doing a phone
screen with a large search (and now mobile OS) company a while ago: the first
question I ask is for the candidate to rate themselves on a scale of 1 to 10
in a number of areas. I explain that 1 is "I think I've heard of that before"
and 10 is "I wrote it, or I know the most that someone could possibly know
about it." About half of the questions I ask are general ones asked of
every candidate, or that come from a pool of such general questions. The other
half are specifically tailored to their responses to the rating, and intended
on figuring out whether their ratings were honest and accurate. Unfortunately,
I have yet to figure out a way (in a 90 minute interview) to reliably differentiate
between someone who's lying and knows it from someone who just doesn't know
the true level of their skills.

The key thing for candidates to know here is that I'm comparing them against
myself, the rest of my team, everyone I've ever worked with, and everyone on
the Internet.

1 - I've never heard of it, or I don't know what it is

5 - my skills are average for someone with my level of experience, applying
for this position here. It's probably also the average for most people on your
team, at least at my level of position.


7. I know a LOT. Ask me a detailed, technical question, and I should be able
   to give you an in-depth answer. 
8. I'm respected as an expert on this. People come to me for help with it. I
   have code contributions merged, documentation fixes, or am otherwise active
   in the community.
9. I know it through an through. I can answer detailed questions about
internals, bugs and edge cases. If I don't have commit access, my name is
still all over the commit logs and/or bug reports.
10. I wrote it, literally. I'm the original author, or at least have him/her
listed as a reference on my resume. I have or had commit access.
