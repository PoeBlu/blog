Summary: A diversion from "all technical" content, on gun ownership in America.
Status: draft

I do my best to keep this blog purely technical. Yes, I occasionally have qualms about that, and wonder if my political, moral and ethical views should have a bit more voice here. But... that's what my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/j_antman) is for. I've had enough experience looking for technical content (during my work day) on the 'net and finding blogs about politics that I try hard not to add to them. But after the events of the past 36 hours - and moreover past decade-plus - I do feel the need to say a few words. So... **be advised**, if you stand strongly on either side of the gun control debate, this probably isn't for you.

I'm a gun owner. I have been since my eighteenth birthday, the day when I became legally able to exercise my second amendment rights in my then-home state of New Jersey. I own a single .22-caliber target pistol; as with any firearm it could certainly be lethal, but it's far from a weapon that someone would choose to use against a human, whatever the reason. I've been shooting off and on since I was in my early teens, mostly handguns and shotguns. Apparently unlike most people who are vocal gun owners, I've never fired a shot at anything that is or was ever alive, unless you count paper. I've never fired a shot outside of a shooting range. While the idea of hunting has occasionally appealed to me, I don't understand the sport of it. The only real appeal that hunting has had to me is in a 'sell all my things, buy land in the middle of nowhere, and see if I can make it' kind of way.

I've never carried a gun in public, nor have I ever had a serious desire to. Despite what gun-rights activists claim about self-defense and defense of others, I think that the way police in this country are both trained and act in the field is a wonderful example of why firearm carry in public often doesn't work: we're talking about people whose *profession* involves firearms, who must train and qualify with their guns annually (or more often), and still often can't hit a target in a real-life situation. As far as I'm concerned, if someone wants to carry a firearm to defend themselves or others, they damn well better be shooting *every day*, doing live-fire training, and completely confident that they could identify and hit a target in real life. To my knowledge, only the most elite units of the military do this.

I now live in Georgia, where anyone can walk into WalMart and walk out with a gun - and many people walk around the store with handguns on their belts, something that's still foreign to me.

On my eighteenth birthday, I went to the police department in my home town to begin the process of purchasing the target pistol that my father had offered as a gift. For those of you who aren't familiar with how gun (specifically handgun - it's significantly easier for shotguns and rifles) ownership works in the northeast, here's the gist of it (my memory may be a bit hazy, and some of it may have been explained poorly):

1. I went to the police department and met with the chief, whom I already knew personally through family.
   * I paid a fee of approximately $100 and filled out about six pages of paperwork, including a full history of my addresses and a lengthy questionnaire.
   * I was fingerprinted - all ten fingers, three sets of prints.
   * I filled out consent forms for federal and state background checks and consents for menthal health records searches.
   * These were all sent out to the respective agencies.
2. About a month later, the chief called to tell me that he'd received the replies from the federal and state governments, and they came back OK (which is to be expected, as I had no mental health history and no criminal record).
3. He then sent out form letters to the three non-related character references I had specified on my application, requesting them to assert under penalty of purjury whether they believed that I posed any danger to myself or others, if I were allowed to purchase a firearm.
4. The letters were all returned by my references. The chief then sent the completed paperwork back to the state government, which issued me a state firearms purchaser identification card, entitling me to purchase firearms and ammunition. I was also issued - as requested - a Permit to Purchase a Handgun, which entitled me to purchase one (1) handgun within 90 days of the date of issue.

Ok, so that's quite a process. All in all, it took two or three months to complete.

When I finally received my ID card and permit - which had to be picked up in person - I headed out to a local gun store to find the model I wanted. And I did. I turned the purchase permit over to the salesperson, who called the state government to verify its validity. We finalized the details of the transaction and I inspected the merchandise and filled out some last paperwork. The gun I'd purchased was then marked with a "sold" sticker and had a copy of the invoice attached, and was locked in a safe for me to pick up in seven days, when the mandatory waiting period was over. When I returned a week later, one of the two spent cartridges from the gun (shipped with it by the manufacturer) was sent to the state police for future forensic use.

And none of this was enough, in my opinion. There was never a follow-up. There was no ongoing monitoring that I'm aware of. I've heard more stories than I can remember of people being convicted of crimes or involved in domestic violence situations, and then using their legally-purchased and registered firearms in future crimes. It makes no sense to me that we live in a world where Amazon knows what items I'm interested in today, but the authorities can't figure out to take my gun away if I assault someone.

I suppose that most of this is based on two of my core beliefs, which run contrary to many gun-rights activists: (1) that my only use for a firearm is target shooting, and it doesn't really matter to me how quickly I can buy one, and (2) that our military has tanks and nukes, and the idea of "defending my Freedom [against a government takeover]" with any legally-purchased weapon is impossible, regardless of whether or not it's simply paranoid.

- the problem IS people who are obtaining weapons legally, not hardcore criminals
- nobody needs an assault rifle or a 50-round magazine
- the mythical, romanticized frontier past
