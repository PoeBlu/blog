I get paid tomorrow, and it's time to spend some money. Sure, there are
some great toys out there. The stuff from
[ThinkGeek](http://www.thinkgeek.com) is always great. What about that
monitoring server I want? Or upgrading my LAN to gigabit copper?

Of course, there are also many charitable causes. The homeless. Cancer.
Strippers without implants.

But this week, I'm going to do something different. I use Open Source
software. My computers run Linux, this site is hosted by Apache, I use
Firefox as a browser. I didn't pay for any of these. But maybe I should,
and the rest of us should too. What's your favorite Open Source project?
They probably accept donations. Projects like Mozilla and Apache even
sell merchandise where some of the profit goes to support development.
Organizations like the Free Software Foundation (FSF) and the Open
Source Initiative (OSI) also accept donations, which they allocate to
legal defense funds and grants to open-source projects.

So, this week, I'm going to do some good.

And for the rest of you, next time you notice a bug or miss a feature in
an open-source project, just think... if everyone who used it donated
$10, would it still be missing?
