So, the semester is finally over. I made it through another one alive.
And aside from a trip to Maryland for five or six days, I'm home until
the 20th of January. That's lots of time to spend running calls for the
[Midland Park (Volunteer) Ambulance
Corps](http://www.midlandparkambulance.com/), here in my home town of
Midland Park, NJ, with which I've been volunteering as an EMT-B for
almost four years now. So far, in the past 24 hours (Christmas Eve and
Christmas Day, I've done 3 runs, which is above average for us - usually
about 1.75/day). It's also a lot of time to spend on some projects of
mine.

I've already setup one of the SunBlade 150 machines as a desktop, and
had to handle a lot of networking stuff (see the [Solaris
Tips](http://www.jasonantman.com/wiki/index.php/Solaris_Tips) page on my
[Wiki](http://www.jasonantman.com)).

In other news, after getting some Christmas and Chanukah (yes, my
father's family is Jewish, and I've yet to find out a single accepted
spelling for the holiday) money, I ran out to a Verizon store and picked
up the phone I've been dreaming of for months - a beautiful NEW (my
first not-used phone in 6 years) Treo 700p. So far, aside from some
problems with the Chatter Email software (to my dismay, I can't find a
free (even as in cost, let alone as in freedom, IMAP client for Palm)
and problems deciding whether or not to pay $25/month for data, I love
it. I still need to deal with Verizon, as they wouldn't let me activate
the phone without a data plan, and the current $45/month "unlimited"
plan is a bit much for me.

So, I have a few big projects planned for the upcoming down time:

1.  Setup my other SunBlade as a mail server running Postfix, Procmail,
    SpamAssassin (with Pyzor or Razor), an IMAP server, and SSL for
    everything.
2.  Setup a Soekris box as a WAP here at home.
3.  Get Chatter Email on the Treo working right with folders (Maildir)
    on my IMAP (Dovecot) server.
4.  Port my GnuPG/Java-based password manager application to J2ME on the
    Treo, and figure out how to sync the databases (just GnuPG-encrypted
    flat files). Also, port it to my Nokia 770 Tablet.
5.  Get my Bluetooth Keyboard (an iGo Ultra Slim) working with the 770 -
    right now, the [Bluetooth
    Plugin](http://770.fs-security.com/maemo-bt-plugin/) crashes the
    unit after typing a few characters.
6.  Do a bunch of overhauling on the website, especially generating
    sitemaps (big issue when you have static content, MediaWiki, and
    source code) and submitting my CVS repo to Google Code Search.

Also, A few <span style="font-weight: bold;">Links</span> for your
enjoyment:  
A [New York Times
blog](http://pogue.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/12/20/the-generational-divide-in-copyright-morality/)
by David Pogue talking about "intellectual property", "copyright
morality", etc. He even goes so far as to imply that making a single
backup copy of a legally purchased DVD is illegal.

A [Groklaw
article](http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20071211055139790&mode=nested)
on the February ISO Ballot Resolution Meeting on MSOOXML. If you're not
familiar with it, check out [noOOXML.org](http://www.noooxml.org/) and
their [petition](http://www.noooxml.org/petition) listing the reasons to
vote NO on the OOXML ballot.

A [CNN
article](http://www.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/asiapcf/12/03/eco.myth.ewaste/index.html)
stating that it's true that "Switching from a Windows-operated computer
to a Linux-operated one could slash computer-generated e-waste levels by
50%."

The Register - [Windows vs. Linux Security
Report](http://www.theregister.co.uk/security/security_report_windows_vs_linux/).

Some interesting Earthlink (yes, apparently they still exist)
newsletters talking about [Linux for the
Desktop](http://www.earthlink.net/elink/issue136/infocus.html) and
[Open-Source
Software](http://www.earthlink.net/elink/issue96/focus_archive.html).

Stay tuned. More updates to come...
