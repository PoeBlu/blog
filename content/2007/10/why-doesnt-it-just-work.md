Well I just finished a healthy 2-hour session with [Google Reader][] and
have a few things to comment on, but at the moment, I just wanted to
make a quick post.

I've been using Linux for five years. I'm in the process of planning to
move a lot of my servers and development systems to the openSolaris
operating system. Overall, I'm a pretty technical person. While I admit
to occasionally using [Webmin][], I'm perfectly comfortable editing the
Apache config files by hand. That being said, with all of the recent
emphasis on Linux as a desktop machine (for end users!) there are some
things that I expect to "just work". When I upgraded for openSuSE 10.2,
and now 10.3RC1, I expected some good desktop technology - granted,
openSuSE isn't the choice for a "just works" end-user desktop.

One word. **Printing.** Despite how I've tried, I still can't get my
Linux boxen to print well. Printing a webpage from Firefox requires
endless tweaking of borders, margins, and other nasty stuff. If I happen
to be in a new location and print something, I grab a pen, as I know
that the headers and footer/last few lines of text on my web page will
be cut off, unless I've tweaked the margins for the specific printer.

Why is this the case? Of all the things that people want Linux to do,
this seems like a simple one. The printable area of an 8 1/2x11" piece
of paper is relatively standard. The actual printable margins for a
given printer are well known. So why is it the my HP LaserJet or my
roommate's Brother 5500DN is such a mystery to Linux?
