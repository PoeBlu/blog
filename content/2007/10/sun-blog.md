Well, I've created my official [Sun Microsystems
blog](http://blogs.sun.com/jantman/) as Campus Ambassador for Rutgers
University. Not that I honestly think anyone reads the non-technical
blog entries here, but if you do, you may want to check out the Sun blog
as well.

Most of the Sun blog entries will probably have to do with Sun
technologies in education or at Rutgers, but when there is something of
interest to a more general audience, I'll be sure to post here as well.

In other news, I'm really really busy lately, between Sun training, my
job (now doing hardware/lab support and some wireless work) for Rutgers,
and school. I have a really long list of things to do personally,
including buying some new systems to move my home/development network
over to the Solaris 10 operating system, getting a new template for this
blog, and wikifying all of my web sites (mostly those at
[jasonantman.com](http://www.jasonantman.com)). To top it all off, my
truck was broken into this afternoon (broad daylight on a busy street)
while I was at class. The front passenger window was smashed in and my
Mio c310x GPS was stolen, so between the window and the GPS, I'm a bit
behind where I'd like to be in terms of budget.
