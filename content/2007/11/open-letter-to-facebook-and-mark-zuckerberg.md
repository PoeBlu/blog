I sent the following as (appropriately enough) a Facebook message to
Mark Zuckerberg:

Dude, I know you're a big-shot, but I thought I'd give this a try, just
giving you (and the Facebook team) some feedback.

I'm growing so frustrated with facebook that I'm thinking of writing my
own alternative. If only I could get people to use it....

The Facebook that I first signed up for (the first day I got my college
e-mail address in July '05) was prefect. I could find pretty much anyone
in any of my classes. I could talk to pretty much anyone at my school,
or most other schools. Most importantly, it was a place to get things
done and connect. It was free of the pressure of overbearing commercial
influence. It was a place where college kids - and only college kids -
could connect.

My suggestion, my plea, is to give us back the old Facebook, or at least
the option to use the old Facebook. The Facebook API was nice, but some
things don't work for it. You took away Courses. Now I can't find people
in my classes, because there are six different applications, each of
which needs to be added separately, and some of which work horribly or
not at all. I don't want all of that junk. I don't want to see a million
boxes with kid-looking drawings and zombies and pirates on someone's
profile. If I wanted to use MySpace, I'd use MySpace!

Newsfeeds. I don't want to know who is trying to turn my friends into a
Zombie or a Warewolf, or something else moronic. Put an option on the
preferences page to get rid of everything through the Facebook API. I
only want to know about stuff that was in the 'Classic Facebook'.

What the f\*\*\* is up with the advertisements in my homepage/news
display? You've already got banners at the left, right, or bottom. Leave
the center panel for the content that I WANT. You can shoves ads
everywhere else on the page, but don't mix an ad for Differin Gel in
with news about my friends.

Make networks more opaque. I only want to know about people who are in
colleges or workplace-related networks. Maybe, and that's just a maybe,
high-school people. but in my opinion, opening Facebook to anyone with
an email address was the worst move you ever made.

So, my suggestions?  
1) The "courses" feature has fragmented way too much. Unify it on a
school-by-school or Facebook-wide basis. I don't want to search 10 API
apps to find someone in my class.  
2) Let me choose whether or not to display Facebook API notices in my
minifeed page. I don't want to know about every time my friends use an
API app.  
3) Take Facebook API stuff off of profile pages. A standardized view is
easy, intuitive, and quick. Searching through a mile-long profile just
to find the Personal Info area is not good.  
4) Bring back a college- or workplace-centric facebook.  
5) Don't try to be MySpace. I stopped using them because of clutter and
annoying extensions. Now Facebook is doing the same thing.  
6) Keep advertisements on the sides or bottom and, most importantly, out
of content areas.

The bottom line - Facebook used to care about users and communication.
Now you just care about profits and advertisers. If you don't want to
lose traffic when something better comes along, give Facebook back to
the people!
