I know i haven't posted in a while.

I'm working on a friend's web site, and needed a specific font for the
title graphic. I couldn't find it \*anywhere\* as a free TTF download
for my Linux machine. However, after asking a friend who's a Mac user, I
got a .dfont file as an email attachment.

After some quick Googling, I came by the [fondu][] project on
SourceForge. I didn't look into it in depth, but I just grabbed the i386
RPM, installed it, and - magic! The in the directory with my .dfont I
now also had .ttf fonts for all of the variants!
