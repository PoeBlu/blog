It seems like it's taken forever. I don't know how many times I've
struggled with web apps that I wrote for the [ambulance
corps](http://www.midlandparkambulance.com) to try and get printed
output correct. I've done everything from generating PDFs, doing screen
captures of a browser and printing as a PDF, to things as crazy as
trying to print schedules directly from the server, where they're setup
as postscript.

I just happened to be going through my news in [Google
Reader](http://reader.google.com) and found some interesting W3C draft
standards for [CSS Print Profiles](http://www.w3.org/TR/css-print/) and
[CSS3 Paged Media Module](http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-page/). *Finally*,
after waiting for literally years, there will (from the way it looks) be
a way for me to specify, in CSS, the page size - and more importantly,
orientation - and have something print correctly.

Perhaps the end of me having to manually print ambulance corps rosters,
and then set the print settings back to landscape and 73% scaling for
the schedule, are finally going to be over!

C'mon, Mozilla, I'm counting on a quick implementation once they're
finalized.
