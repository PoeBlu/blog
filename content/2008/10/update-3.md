It's been a long month and a half or so. A bunch of new projects at work
(and interviewing for a full-time position) and lots of school stuff,
all on top of having my truck stolen, dealing with insurance and the
police, and then recovering it, and dealing with insurance again. It's a
long long story, which I posted as a Note on facebook.

[PHP EMS Tools](http://www.php-ems-tools.com) is due for a major
revision, and hopefully this will include, among other things, the
following new features:

1.  Support for [i18n](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I18n).
2.  Install-time choice of using MySQL or LDAP as a roster and
    authentication storage system.
3.  Some vastly more efficient changes to the database schema,
    specifically dealing with scheduling.

I'm still working on some other big projects, namely the migration of
this blog to [WordPress](http://wordpress.org/), the migration of
[JasonAntman.com](http://www.jasonantman.com) to some real CMS (Joomla,
Drupal, etc.), and migration of my home internet connection from
residential FiOS to "business-grade" Optimum Online (cable) - which will
probably see a slight decrease in reliability from the amazing levels of
FiOS, but will give me five static IPs and no ports blocked.

On the other hand, there's been a wrench thrown into all of my plans for
big projects (not even mentioning the projects that have been cast aside
- [TuxTruck](http://www.tuctruck.org),
[tuxOstat](http://jantman.dyndns.org:10011/tuxostat/) which is now down,
and a bunch of others. That wrench is the [T-Mobile
G1](http://www.t-mobileg1.com/), the GooglePhone finally come to
fruition. I was psyched about Android when I first heard about it, and
the idea of finally having a phone that I can develop for without
learning a new language sounds amazing. I'll admit that at $180 with a
2-year contract, plus $80/month for service (split about 50/50 between
the voice plan and the unlimited data plan) it doesn't make the best
financial sense for someone whose car was stolen and now has 2 vehicles
- only one of which I can afford - but I'm really excited. I've heard
some not-so-good things about the quality of the GPS, and some of the
apps currently available, but within a few months, I'd assume that the
effects of open development will cause it to greatly surpass the
functionality of my current Treo 700p, running my beloved Palm OS (which
I've been dedicated to for the better part of seven years).

While the all-around flexibility of Android and its' apps is definitely
one of the biggest selling points, my own interest is mainly in the
ability to quickly develop Java apps that bring my already-existing
web-based forms and data to the desktop of my phone. It's the simplicity
that is my biggest interest - even for simple purposes, like converting
the web-based fuel log I keep for my car(s) to a dedicated Java-based
form on my phone.

Stay tuned...
