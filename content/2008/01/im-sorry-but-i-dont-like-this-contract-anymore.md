The other big news in tech today - as posted on [slashdot][], the author
of the pchdtvr/atscap package previously on SourceForge has [announced
his attempt to <span style="font-weight: bold;">retroactively</span>
remove his package from GPL coverage][]. His post states, in part,

> I have revoked the licensing under the GNU General Public  
> License (herein after referred to as "the GPL") for the  
> atscap version 1.1 codebase, all prior versions of the  
> atscap codebase and all the various release candidates of  
> the atscap codebase.  
> [...]  
> As sole author of both the atscap and the pchdtvr codebases,  
> the licenses under the GPL were granted at my sole  
> discretion and the licenses under the GPL are now hereby  
> revoked at my sole discretion.  
> [...]

So not only is this guy trying to retroactively unassign rights that he
has previously irrecovably assigned, but he's
<span style="font-weight: bold;">asking developers to pull his code from
their codebase</span>???? I mean, that's not just an inconvenience. Does
he comprehend what he's asking? To pull a few excerpts from [GPLv2][]:  

> 1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source
> code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously
> and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice
> and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to

> recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the
> Program.  
> 6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
> Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
> original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
> these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further

> </p>

Apparently this is being [discussed at length over at GrokLaw,][]
including the analysis, "If you change your mind and don't want to use
the GPL any more, you can stop and use something else on new code going
forward, and you can dual license your own code, but you can't redo the
past and pull back GPL'd code". The developer is telling people to
delete their copies, and to cease distribution. Now, I'm not a lawyer,
and I'm not an expert on copyright law. But I didn't think that one
party to a contract could unilaterally alter it if there weren't any
terms allowing such an action, and the [GPL FAQ][]seems to support this.

Take an example: Your car breaks down. You have planned a family
vacation tomorrow. The car dealer, out of the kindness of their hearts
(ha ha) gives you a free loaner car. You sign the agreement to keep the
loaner until your car is fixed, pack up the car with all of your
luggage, and head off on the trip, stopping at a hotel along the way. In
the morning, you wake up, walk out to the hotel parking lot, and find
all of your luggage in a pile in a parking space - no car! On top of the
pile is a letter reading, "we're sorry, but we decided that we don't
want you to have this free loaner car anymore. We've taken it back. Have
a nice trip."

My biggest curiosity, though, is what happened to the developer. He was
using the SourceForge account "inkling", but it seems like both of his
previous projects are now gone, along with any other relevant
information. I'd sure like to see his response to the community
regarding this incident.
