It's a wonderful day. And if you haven't taken a swing by the [Firefox
Download Site](http://www.spreadfirefox.com/en-US/worldrecord) yet
today, shame on you! Mozilla is attempting to get the Guinness World
Record for most software downloads in 24 hours - and that 24 hours ends
at 2:16 PM EDT today! So run over and get it... now! (and please
download from Mozilla's site so they have an accurate count).

Anyway, I'm going to do my part by downloading the Linux tarball on
every machine I have that has a graphical display - though I don't know
if my NAT will end up being counted as one download. For the Linux users
out there, I was able to find an RPM [on the openSuSE
site](http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/mozilla:/beta/openSUSE_10.3/i586/)
though I'm not yet sure whether it's the release or the beta version.
Windows and Mac users have it easier - Mozilla packages software for
you, we have to do it ourselves or wait for someone else to.

Anyway, Firefox 3 is supposed to have much better memory usage, be a bit
faster, and also have some great [feature
enhancements](http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/features/).
