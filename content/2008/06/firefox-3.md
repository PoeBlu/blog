Well, Firefox 3 is here. And it's wonderful. I've had it running all
day, and absolutely love it. I just got FFX 3 running on my laptop (my
primary workstation). The memory management does appear to be better -
nowhere near as much of a strain on the laptop (a mere 1GB RAM), and
better page load time. I'm not sure how I feel about the UI changes, but
those can be dealt with...

For everyone who downloaded Firefox 3 today - good job! Over
<span style="font-weight: bold;">8 Million</span> downloads in 24 hours,
and inching up to 580 Million total downloads of Firefox!!!

Want to hear a figure even more amazing, from Mozilla's [Blog of
Metrics][]? It's only been <span style="font-weight: bold;">a little
over twenty four hours since the launch</span>, and "According the [live
tracking][] from Net Applications, Fx3 has been hovering around 4%
worldwide market share."
