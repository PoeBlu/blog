The next week will be quite busy. For one, I'm going to attempt an
[OpenSolaris](http://www.opensolaris.org/os/) operating system
installation on my [Asus
eeePC](http://event.asus.com/eeepc/microsites/en/index.htm). Last I
heard, there were some compatibility issues - though this was my first
attempt at running the Solaris operating system on a laptop, and it took
quite an effort to get my favorite mainstream Linux distro installed on
the eeePC, though I've been running that on laptops for 6+ years.

This Sunday, March 30<sup>th</sup>, the [Rutgers University Student Linux Users'
Group](http://ruslug.rutgers.edu/w/) (RUSLUG) will be hosting our annual
Installfest in the [EIT Lab](http://ruslug.rutgers.edu/w/EitDirections)
from 10 AM until 6 PM. While the event is generally marketed towards
Linux newbies, it's usually attended by a diverse range of students (and
staff) from first-timers to Solaris sysadmins. I'll be attendance, as
always, and will also be conducting some demos of new Sun technology
(mainly OpenSolaris and NetBeans). For anyone in the New
Brunswick/Pisctaway area, I'll also be armed with some door prizes and a
whole plethora of CDs and DVDs. For anyone interested, I'll be providing
information and pointers on NetBeans and Solaris, as well as
installation assistance (and maybe some prizes) for anyone looking to
give OpenSolaris a whirl on their system.

Following up the Installfest, on Tuesday, April 1<sup>st</sup> at 9 PM (also in
the EIT lab) will be the RUSLUG Newbie Night. It's generally a
fun-filled evening with [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/) LiveCDs and a
general Q&A session about Linux. Generally this includes one-on-one
assistance for new Linux users. In an effort to raise the level of
content (and provide a diversion for more experienced users if there
aren't many new faces), I'll be once again demo'ing some Sun technology,
and specifically providing an overview of my recently completed personal
mailserver migration from SuSE Linux to OpenSolaris. Once again,
visitors can expect some door prizes and lots of fun CDs to take home.

In other RUSLUG news:

-   It looks like I'll be running to become an officer next year. Anyone
    else at Rutgers can feel free to contact me with ideas, etc.
-   RUSLUG's current box,
    [ruslug.rutgers.edu](http://ruslug.rutgers.edu/), is a Dell desktop
    thrown on a shelf in a closet. I'd like to find someone willing to
    help out with procuring a new box. It doesn't need to be anything
    fancy - just pretty simple, though I'd like to look into high
    capacity storage for mirroring distros. FYI, the current box is a
    Dell desktop with a 1.7GHz P-4 (256KB cache), 512 MB RAM, and about
    250GB of IDE storage (150GB + 100GB, no RAID). We don't need a big
    upgrade in processor power, but more RAM and RAID for the system and
    user disks would be nice (distro mirrors can be a big IDE/SATA or an
    external disk).
