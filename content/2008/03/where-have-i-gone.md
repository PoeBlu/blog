Well, it's been a while since I posted. Things have been horribly busy
in the school world, and I have some new projects I'm working on as
well. Unfortunately, due to limited resources at the moment, I haven't
been able to give Zenoss a try. If I eventually find a nice 25-30U rack
for the [hardware running JasonAntman.com][] (in the basement of my
suburban home, so headroom is limited to about six feet), I'll probably
move one or two machines from my apartment back there, reorganize
things, and setup a Zenoss test (\*if\* I can get Xen to play well with
some OS that has Zenoss RPMs, or give up and compile from source).  
A few of my new projects:

-   Some embedded Linux work
-   Getting my new [Deluo USB WAAS GPS][] working with my eeePC, and
    eventually add software for mapping wireless networks
-   Mount an external 2.4GHz antenna on my truck, so I can hop on
    [RUwireless][] without leaving the comfort of my home on wheels.
-   Get a "N" wireless card and beta the wireless-N at Rutgers.
-   Figure out development for PalmOS, and write a program to sync my
    Palm calendar with [Google Calendar][] over-the-air.
-   Do some work with a radio scanner and a system at home for recording
    and logging (maybe even [MDC1200][] decoding).

My pet peeve for the day - blogs and other websites that don't list a
date last updated. I've been looking around for alternatives to
[KPilot][], and I have to look through all of the Google results, and
figure out how old they are based on version numbers and which Palm
devices are listed.

And, from Rutgers Telecommunications, this is what RUwireless looked
like over spring break, and the Monday that everyone came back:
