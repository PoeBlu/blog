Just a little comment. I'm usually not one to click on ads, but when I
saw a banner ad for a NEC projector with 3000 ANSI lumens for under
$1000 USD, I just had to take a look.

The [NEC product
page](http://www.necdisplay.com/Products/Product/?product=71957542-7825-400f-997e-c7a2b8a01d06)
has a nice little sidebar to "Check out how NEC displays are being used
by businesses". Hoping that they might say something about displaying
the output of an
[NMS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_management_system), I decided
to go for a look. Now, a little note about my browsing habits. I use
[Firefox](http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/?from=getfirefox), and
have since it came out. I can't use anything else - after all, I need my
two dozen [add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/). Like any
good Firefox user, I use tabs. At the moment, I have about a dozen open.
Sometimes I have three times that (and I've never found problems with
that. Try it in IE, I dare you). (Side note - I don't understand how IE
can still have market share, but not have an add-on facility like
Firefox. Then again, they're 3 years behind in almost all features...).

So, I unsuspectingly right-click on the link to "Learn More", hoping for
a nice right-click context menu. What do I get? A Flash menu. I
Ctrl-click, and get the page I wanted - in the same window.

First of all, it's not animated, there's no reason why they need Flash
to do what can be done with a simple image. Just another thing I hate
about wed design - the use of "advanced" technologies (read:
non-interoperable) when they're not needed. But more importantly,
respect your users' browsing habits. The right-click menu has a purpose.
And if your users want to open a link in a new tab/window, let them.

On the converse side of things, why doesn't Macromedia get their act
together and make flash into a technology that follows the functionality
of the rest of the web? Surely right-clicking on a link wouldn't be that
hard to implement...
