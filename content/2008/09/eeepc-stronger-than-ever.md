It seems like every time I open up my [Google
Reader](http://reader.google.com) account, there's news about another
company that released a knock-off of my beloved [Asus eeePC 4G Surf
(701)](http://eeepc.asus.com/global/700.htm) (interestingly, it looks
like eeepc.asus.com is down at the moment of writing). Even Asus has
released numerous (I think the product like is now up to about 10
variations) follow-ups to the 7" beauty, now up to 10" in size (though,
admittedly, I'm less-than-enthused about their Windows models).

With the new semester here, I am (unfortunately) back in class. And I'm
very happy to report that I'm starting to see eeePCs in more and more
hands. Granted, my classes are in the IT program, but I was quite
surprised last night to be sitting in my Internet Security class and
notice no less than four eeePCs in a class of about 25 people. While
I've just relegated my own 4G to my server room bag, replacing it with a
(used, surplus from work) IBM ThinkPad T41 (14.1" display, 1.4GHz
Pentium, 768MB RAM, and a DVD drive). Though my heart sank when I found
that half of the eeePCs were running Windows, it seems that in my
travels around campus, I'm seeing more and more eeePCs, and more laptops
running Linux.

While the academic world has surely embraced new technologies, and
non-mainstream technologies, quicker than other sectors (specifically
considering Linux and the apparent popularity of the eeePC), it's
definitely a good omen. Seeing non-geek, and perhaps even non-CS and
non-Engineering, students using Linux speaks quite well for the
expansion of the Linux user base when these students graduate and enter
the "real world"
