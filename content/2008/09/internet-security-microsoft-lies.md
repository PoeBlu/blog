**Internet Security**

So, this semester I'm taking a class on Internet Security. Our textbook
is [Management of Internet Security, 2nd
Edition](http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbninquiry.asp?ean=1423901304)
by Michael E. Whitman and Herbert J. Mattord. It seems pretty basic, and
very much focused on the management side of things (as opposed to
technical). The table of contents is as follows:

1.  Introduction to the Management of Information Security
2.  Planning for Security
3.  Planning for Contingencies
4.  Information Security Policy
5.  Developing the Security Program
6.  Security Management Models and Practices
7.  Risk Management: Identifying and Assessing Risk
8.  Risk Management: Assessing and Controlling Risk
9.  Protection Mechanisms
10. Personnel and Security
11. Law and Ethics
12. Information Security Project Management

Now, given that it's really a "management" book, I can't say I'm
surprised that it reads like an essay that was graded on a scale of
buzzwords-per-sentence. However, it seems to be missing the one chapter
that's the most important - actually, the only chapter that would be in
the book if I wrote it - "How to get management to allocate the money
you need for proper security." In fact, skimming over the book, I found
a lot of content on general management planning, job descriptions,
sample policies, and a lot of other pie-in-the-sky stuff, but not one
concrete section dedicated to the most difficult part of security -
getting the "resources" to do it right!

**Microsoft Lies**

Why we would spend time analyzing corporate mission statements in an
Internet Security class, I have no idea. That seems, to me, too much
like what we covered in "Management of Technological Organizations."
But, we do, and one of the examples used is [Microsoft's Mission and
Values statement](http://www.microsoft.com/About/default.mspx). Perhaps,
being the F/OSS advocate that I am, my reading of it was a bit cynical.
Let's take a look at it.

"At Microsoft, our mission and values are to help people and business
throughout the world realize their full potential." Well, we're off to a
good start. Aside from the fact that they want you to realize that
potential using **only their software**, and use their power and money
to actively monopolize (or attempt to) most industries that they enter,
this seems pretty run-of-the-mill.

*Corporate Citizenship:*"Every successful corporation has *a
responsibility to use its resources and influence to make a positive
impact on the world and its people*. Microsoft’s Global Citizenship
Initiative is focused on mobilizing our resources across the company and
around the world, to create opportunities in the communities where we do
business, and to *fulfill our commitment to serving the public good
through innovative technologies and partnerships*." Well. Now we're
getting somewhere. Apparently "a positive impact on the world and its
people" is defined as trying to monopolize every sector that Microsoft
touches, whether attempting to crush and then buy-out the competition,
or through flat-out
[FUD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear,_uncertainty_and_doubt) and
billion-dollar marketing campaigns. Hmm... innovative partnerships... as
in Novell?

*Legal and Corporate Affairs:*"Microsoft’s Legal and Corporate Affairs
Group works on the cutting edge of business and regulatory issues around
the world." Well, I can't argue with that, they sure are on the cutting
edge. What started with Bill Gates mailing out whiny letters about
pirated Altair BASIC has now turned into a global juggernaut, capable of
forcing the creation of ISO standards at their whim, and successfully
quashing any dissent about obviously flawed and under-reviewed
"standards" (which, in fact, simply describe current software, rather
than setting any real standard).

*Values:*As a company, and as individuals, we value **integrity**,
**honesty**, **openness**, personal excellence, **constructive
self-criticism**, **continual self-improvement**, and **mutual
respect**. We are committed to our customers and partners and have a
passion for technology. We take on big challenges, and pride ourselves
on seeing them through. **We hold ourselves accountable to our
customers**, shareholders, partners, and employees by honoring our
commitments, providing results, and **striving for the highest
quality**.

1.  **integrity** - i.e. not creating a draft ISO standard and then
    [offering monetary incentives for
    acceptance](http://www.networkworld.com/news/2007/083007-microsoft-employee-offered-incentives-for.html).
2.  **honesty** - when it works. Intentionally making Vista-Capable
    labeling so ambiguous that it even [confuses Microsoft
    executives](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/09/business/09digi.html?_r=1&oref=slogin)?
    Fine.
3.  **openness** um... did they seriously say that? Openness like...
    protocol interoperability? Standards that can be implemented without
    patent violations? An "Open Specification Promise" that doesn't come
    with a [three page
    FAQ](http://www.microsoft.com/interop/osp/default.mspx)? Nope. Not
    Microsoft.
4.  **constructive self-criticism** - Ok, I'll give them this one. They
    do, rarely, criticize themselves. Though "constructive" usually
    means making comments about the poor design of a previous product,
    and suggesting that everyone upgrade to the new version.
5.  **continual self-improvement** - I'll give them this one too. In
    fact, they're so crazy about it that they've been improving the same
    codebase for decades!
6.  **mutual respect** - See above.
7.  **We hold ourselves accountable to our customers** - Ok. They *are*
    offering to allow users to [downgrade from Vista to
    XP](http://download.microsoft.com/download/5/f/4/5f4c83d3-833e-4f11-8cbd-699b0c164182/royaltyoemreferencesheet.pdf).
8.  **striving for the highest quality** - I don't think so. They're
    striving for products that have the highest *market share*. As long
    as the quality is acceptable to the majority of users, and the
    products do what the majority of users need, that's fine. But
    wait... apparently they even missed *that* goal with Vista.

This is just the opinion of one person. My motivations may be diverse,
and surely there's a bit of zealotry in there. After all, if Ford told
me I couldn't put fog lights on my car myself, I had to bring it to the
dealer and pay $400, I'd stop buying their cars - and make sure everyone
else knew what they did. But there's also my ever-present desire to make
sure people know both sides of the story, and all the facts. The
mainstream media (specifically dumbed-down television) rarely reports on
the less cheerful side of Microsoft, like the ISO "standard"
[scandal](http://www.networkworld.com/news/2007/083007-microsoft-employee-offered-incentives-for.html),
or the [Vista
letters](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/09/business/09digi.html?_r=1&oref=slogin),
or the
[Vista-Capable](http://yro.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=08/04/22/2032232&from=rss)
fiasco. And I find this to be horribly disturbing. Many people don't
realize that there *are* alternatives to Microsoft products, even ones
that are provided by such big names as [Sun
Microsystems](http://www.sun.com) and [IBM](http://www.ibm.com). But,
most striking, is Microsoft's overwhelming monopoly. Windows' market
share is currently
[90.66%](http://marketshare.hitslink.com/report.aspx?qprid=8) or higher.
I ask you, what other industries which affect not only consumers, but
nearly every aspect of our daily lives (as computing does) would be
allowed to have such a monopoly? It has happened in many other American
industries - oil, steel, the railroads, telephone service. Where is the
government now?

What happened to the America that made massive monopolies illegal? Have
we forgotten a supremely part of our history that began in 1980 with the
Sherman Act? Or even the recent events with Bell? In order to truly
stimulate competition in the software industry, and provide for not only
choice but the improved quality, reliability, and security that comes
with true software competition, something needs to be done. For
starters, how about breaking Microsoft into separate entities - browser,
Office, OS, server, etc. And - the important part - preventing any
package sales, discounts, or bundling between the separate types of
software (and separate companies).
