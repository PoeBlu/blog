Tropical Storm [Hanna](http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/#HANNA) is expected to
reach the New Jersey area on Saturday, September 6, 2008. The latest
predictions as of 20:00 September 4^th^ call for winds from 30-60 MPH
and rainfall possibly in excess of 5 inches, at a rate of 1-1.5 inches
per hour (as per the [Bergen County Office of Emergency
Management](http://www.bcoem.org/)).

In light of this, please be advised that
[JasonAntman.com](http://www.jasonantman.com) may experience some
unscheduled downtime - mainly due to the fact that my internet
connection (Verizon FiOS fiber, right now) is run with suspended
pole-to-pole cables. If this does happen (and power is still available)
I'll make an effort to use the downtime as best as possible.
