I don't know if I'm the only one experiencing this, but this is the
third time in two days that I've gotten a 503 when trying to view my
bookmarks on [del.icio.us][]. This is posing a problem, as I use the
service to keep my bookmarks in sync between five computers.

As of the time of this post, I'm able to get to the site again, but I
was unable to get there - or update my bookmarks on my main workstation
at work - for about ten minutes.
