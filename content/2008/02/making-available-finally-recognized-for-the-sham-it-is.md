From A [Groklaw article
today](http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20080226005921833):

In *Atlantic v. Brennan*, the courts have finally recognized RIAA's
"making available" argument for the sham it is. Groklaw has a link to
the full ruling, which includes:

> At least one aspect of Plaintiffs' distribution claim is problematic,
> however, namely the allegation of infringement based on "mak[ing] the
> Copyrighted Recordings available for distribution to others."... This
> amounts to a valid ground on which to mount a defense, for
> "without actual distribution of copies . . .
> there is no violation [of] the distribution right." 4 William
> F. Patry, *Patry on Copyright* ยง 13:9 (2007); *see also id.* n.10
> (collecting cases); *Perfect 10, Inc. v. Amazon.com, Inc*., 508 F.3d
> 1146, 1162 (9th Cir. 2007) (affirming the district court's finding
> "that distribution requires an 'actual dissemination' of a copy").

Also, finally, the judge
rejected the claims as being speculative, as they all rested on the
"upon information and belief" statements.

Maybe things will start going in the right direction...
