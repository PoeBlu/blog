I happened to visit Google Webmaster Tools tonight. On the down side, a
lot more of my redirected pages ([jantman.dyndns.org:10011][]) are
indexed than those from the domain ([jasonantman.com][]). On the
positive side, my search stats are quite impressive - for example,
[searching "hpadu"][] (the HP Proliant Array Diagnostic Utility) gives
my [Wiki][jasonantman.com]as the \#9 result - searching ["hpasm
sles10"][] shows my site as \#3! Most amazingly, there are only two HP
pages above mine in both of the queries.

I guess trying to put every bit of knowledge I pick up in my blog or
wiki pays off. And hopefully some people are getting help.

On another note, later this week I'm going to setup two virtual machines
on my spare PowerEdge 650 to test some [network monitoring systems][] -
specifically, [Hyperic HQ][], [OpenNMS][], and [Groundwork Open
Source][]. Thanks to [John][], Peter, and [Jeff G][]. (of OpenNMS) for
finding my little-known blog and suggesting I try them. I don't know how
much I'll be able to run on this poor system (2.4GHz P-III is the
fastest I have, but 768MB RAM is a bit weak), but I'll do the best I
can, and post my results.

One comment - I can't seem to find a feature list for [OpenNMS][], so I
may be wrong, but it looks like [Hyperic HQ][] may be in the lead at the
moment, simply because it seems to include built-in asset tracking with
hardware discovery - something that takes me way too long to manually
keep up-to-date. On another side-note, the web site for [Groundwork Open
Source][] leaves a sour taste in my mouth, as it's pretty sparse -
there's a lot of space given to the Enterprise edition, but not much
text about the Open Source version.
