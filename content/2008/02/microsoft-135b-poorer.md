Yeah, I almost forgot to link right to the[article from Reuters about
the EU fining Microsoft][] $1.35 BILLION USD (899 million euros).

Microsoft's monopolistic business practices are costing it billions of
dollars.

IDEA:  
Actually be open. Open up all of your protocols, specifications, APIs.
Even start opening up some of your source code, under GPLv3, and
assigning patents to the [Patent Common][][s][Patent Common].

Believe it or not, your sales will go up. Maybe then Bill can donate the
next $1B in fines to some starving kids who need laptops.

Seriously though, if I could get Windows Server under GPLv3, and do
whatever I want - fork it, whatever, I might buy a copy. I'm sure a lot
of people would if they realized that they could change it, wouldn't get
locked in, etc.
