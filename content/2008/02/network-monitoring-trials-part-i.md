After dinner tonight, I'm going to start setting up my Xen VMs and
installing some monitoring software. I've decided that [Hyperic][] and
[OpenNMS][] will be the first round - mainly because their free versions
seem to be the most heavy-weight, and will probably take more
installation time. [GroundWork Open Source][] will come sometime later
this week.

While the research that I did today has led me to start formulating some
opinions on each of the contestants, I'm going to withhold comment until
I get all three up and running, and have done some real work with them.
