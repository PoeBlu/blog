Here's [another Groklaw article on recent Microsoft
tribulations](http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20080227031234460).
This really is starting to get disgusting. It's not that I hate
Microsoft, I don't. What I hate is their attitude, and their business
practices. Everyone else - I mean *everyone* - makes software that
interoperates with other vendors. Microsoft, even after a *billion*
dollar fine, won't. Everyone else uses open, industry-accepted
standards. Microsoft doesn't. Many other vendors open up their code.
Microsoft tried to make some vague gesture to, but makes it incompatible
with GPL'd code (okay, okay, I know about ZFS...) and says developers
can only use it in non-commercial projects. So they open a few things up
to hobbyists, and want a pat on the back. It boils down to how they
treat customers and developers. Not very well. I don't like that. I'm
not going to start on the technical aspects of Windows, though it seems
to be getting better, a baby step at a time. But the bottom line is that
Microsoft actively tries to turn the software industry into a facist
dictatorship, where you do it Microsoft's way, or you're taken out back
and shot (ok, bought up and then shut down).

Anyway, from the blog of Zeheda Bhorat, Open Source Programs Manager at
Google,

How can it be that the ISO - the International
Organization for *Standardization* - would
actually consider a *second*,
competing standard for document formats. And one that's [as flawed as
OOXML](http://www.noooxml.org/argu-brief)? These guys are the ISO. They
practically run the world, at least technically. Why don't they have the
balls to look Microsoft in the eye and say, "Hey, moron. We already
**have** a document format
standard. It's called ISO 26300. If you want to have anything to do with
the ISO, which sets *standards*,
you can take your 6,000 page specification, put it through a crosscut
paper-burning radiation-producing shredder, pay the $320 for a copy of
ISO26300, and implement it!"
