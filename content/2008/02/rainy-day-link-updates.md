Well, today happens to be my 21st birthday. Now, not only can I vote or
die for my country, but I can finally buy a drink when a president I
didn't vote for sends me off to war! All kidding aside, almost every
year I can remember, it's either snowed on my birthday, or been a rainy,
slushy mess. This year appears to be the latter - an utterly disgusting
mix of rain, slushy snow, and little chunks of ice from last night.

I haven't had much time this week to do anything interesting - it's been
a busy week for class-related stuff, and a bunch of work-related stuff
too. So, I guess I'll just post some interesting links for the past few
days...

[Sun Microsystems has announced that we'll be acquiring
Innotek](http://www.sun.com/aboutsun/pr/2008-02/sunflash.20080212.1.xml),
and therefore VirtualBox. This means that Sun's virtualization products
will now reach to the desktop - and that I should give VirtualBox a shot
for running OpenSolaris on my laptop. (aside: why is virtualization not
in my Firefox spell check yet???)

Researchers at the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center have come out with
[a version of SSH / SCP that uses
multi-threading](http://www.psc.edu/networking/projects/hpn-ssh/), for
use in high-bandwidth applications on multi-core systems.

[An ITnews article on why Open Source needs better
PR](http://www.itnews.com.au/Feature/4203,linux-we-have-a-pr-problem.aspx).

What? Microsoft sued *again*?
[Ars Technica ran an article on the Vista Capable
fiasco](http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20080211-vista-capable-scheme-was-panned-at-microsoft.html),
with some comments from MS insiders. How is it that such a big company,
with such a ubiquitous product, can constantly be sued, have MAJOR
screwups, screw over their customers, and still people come back for
more?

[BBC News - EU Competition Regulators raid Intel offices in
Munich](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7241022.stm).

A CNet article (linked from [John M. Willis' ESM
Blog](http://www.johnmwillis.com/cms/us-treasury-wasting-tens-of-millions-on-a-1-million-problem/))
on the [US Treasury upping its content management budget to $28.2
million](http://blogs.cnet.com/8301-13505_1-9870273-16.html?tag=head) -
no wonder why ww have so much debt, nobody told them about Drupal. From
the article - "tens of millions on a $1 million problem".

Wiki](http://nagioswiki.com/wiki/index.php/Main_Page), liked in a
[Groundwork blog
entry](http://www.groundworkopensource.com/community/blog/?p=135).
