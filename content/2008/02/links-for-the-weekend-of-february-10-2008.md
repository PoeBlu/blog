Well, I don't have much time for a real post. I'm quite busy with school
work and prepping for an [OpenSolaris](http://www.opensolaris.org) demo
at [RUSLUG](http://ruslug.rutgers.edu) on this Tuesday. Also, I've
pretty much finished my initial evaluation of [Hyperic
HQ](http://www.hyperic.com) and, after reviewing the features of most of
the options, I'm looking at [Zenoss Core](http://www.zenoss.com) for the
next round.

So, instead of anything interesting, a few news stories from the past
few days:

-   Slashdot - an interesting [article on search and seizure of
    electronic devices at
    airports](http://yro.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=08/02/10/1251233&from=rss)

-   From
    [asuseeehacks.blogspot.com](http://asuseeehacks.blogspot.com/2008/02/security-alert-asus-eee-pc-vulnerable.html),
    also [bugtraq](http://seclists.org/bugtraq/2008/Feb/0086.html) - the
    Asus eeePC apparently has a root-level vulnerability in its'
    out-of-the-box Xandros distro, involving Samba. For people like me
    who put a much better OS on it, it's not a big problem.
-   [InformationWeek is
    reporting](http://www.informationweek.com/news/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=206106956)
    that the EU is investigating Microsoft - again. This time, for
    violating antitrust laws during its' push for MSOOXML. There's also
    [a small page at GrokLaw dedicated to this newest
    development](http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20080208151410252).
-   [According to Ars
    Technica](http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20080207-controversial-college-funding-bill-passedp2p-proviso-intact.html),
    the congressional bill on college funding that would require schools
    to filter out P2P traffic has PASSED in the House, with the
    filtering clause intact. Fine. Whatever. A gross invasion of
    privacy, and of college students' rights, but that's nothing new.
    However, if I'm sitting in my office at Rutgers and have a
    *single hiccup* downloading
    the OpenSuSE Beta 1 via BitTorrent on April 17th, mark my words, my
    congressmen (and Rutgers administrators) will learn my phone number
    by heart.
-   [Some progress in Arista v. Does
    1-21](http://recordingindustryvspeople.blogspot.com/2008/02/judge-grants-eff-motion-for-leave-to.html),
    the RIAA's attack on Boston University students. But, unfortunately,
    the end of the McCarthy-esque tactics doesn't seem to be near yet
    and, even worse for me, neither does the likelihood that the
    recording industry will wake up and see what the market's asking
    for, and give me downloadable DRM-free music and movies.
