It's April 1<sup>st</sup>, also known as April Fool's Day. While I,
unfortunately, haven't planned any pranks or jokes myself this year (I
guess I've just been too busy), I always try to find as many of
[Google](http://www.google.com)'s jokes as possible. Despite being a
behemoth, and raking in billions of dollars, they still seem to keep an
excellent sense of humor, both for everyone and at a very technical
level.

Here's what I found this year (updated as I find them):

1.  ![topeka](/GFX/topeka-hp.gif)
   Google name change to Topeka - [blog
    post](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/04/different-kind-of-company-name.html),
    [CNN
    Money](http://money.cnn.com/2010/04/01/technology/google_april_fools/)
    - Topeka, Kansas changes name to Google, Kansas. Google changes name
    to Topeka.
2.  Search result timing - A Google search for "Jason Antman" was
    completed in "2.00 shakes of a lamb's tail".

On a side note, I'm quite sad that the Store Anything [beta test
form](https://spreadsheets.google.com/viewform?hl=en&formkey=dEx3d1BSR1Ntb0hvdEpJNkJvaUI2Z2c6MQ)
([local copy](/GFX/viewform.html))doesn't work. When they asked what
object I wanted to store, I checked "other" for "exotic matter", and
entered the following description of why I should be allowed to test the
service:

> Luckily for google, the exotic matter that I intend to store has a
> negative mass. Not only is it much simpler for me to let Google's
> massive engineering team (the same one that figured out how to run
> their search engine on SkyLab and the WOPR) figure out how to store
> such a substance, but it also means that I should be able to receive
> storage for free. In fact, my collection of negative mass matter
> should be large enough (no pun intended) to offset the entire cost of
> Store Antyhing!

Of course, Google has a history of April Fool's pranks that goes back to
the earliest days. Much can be found about them
[online](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google's_hoaxes). But by far my
favorite was last year, when (in an apparent showing of how easy it is
for them to make changes to GWS and roll them out over their entire
infrastructure) they changed the Server HTTP header to a number of
random and humorous names, including Microsoft IIS/3.0, Apache/0.8.4,
HAL 9000, WOPR, CERN, and SkyNet.
