Title: My Droid Rooting Dilemma

My Droid is still running 2.0.1 rooted, with SPS Recovery, just as it
was the week the 2.0.1 update was pushed out OTA - I'd already rooted
it, disabled OTA updates, and performed a simple procedure to update and
keep root.

My one complaint is that - as always happens with a new and cool
technology that gets widely adopted - it seems like the Android
community is being, well, dumbed down. When I first rooted my Droid, it
involved using the adb shell. Now, it's hard to find instructions that
aren't written exclusively for Windows - or even instructions that
actually explain what I'm supposed to be doing or why it works.

I know that I haven't followed the Android world much lately, but it
seems to me that this should be really simple. The update.zip OTA
updates are just patches. I already have the device rooted on 2.0.1,
have disabled OTA updates, etc. So it seems to me that I should be able
to just unzip the update file, change whatever needs to be changed to
keep root, re-zip it, and upload it. If it wasn't already done (the
HowTo that I followed to update to rooted 2.0.1 doesn't seem to be
online anymore, and I can't find the URL), I should be able to just
change the update verification keys to accept anything.

Well, I guess it's time to continue my hours of research and see if I
can come up with anything. Everything I've already found says that I
have to backup all of my apps and data and just flash a new ROM, but
that seems stupid. Why can't I just make use of this wonderful
patch-based updating and keep root?
