Just a short update... I know I haven't posted anything in quite a
while, but I hope to get back into the habit of doing so... or even
making daily posts like I had wanted.

1.  The [truck that was totaled](/2010/05/truck-totaled/) has been
    replaced with a newer, nicer one.
2.  I've spent most of the past month working on a large DHCP project at
    work, which I hope to write about in depth at some point.
3.  I bought the parts to make an Arduino-based OBD-II display, and I'm
    slowly making some progress on it (mostly delayed because the $12
    "HD44780-compatible" LCD display I bought doesn't work in 4-bit
    mode).
