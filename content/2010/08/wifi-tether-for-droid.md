My Motorola Droid (purchased on [November 10^th^, 2009][], 4 days after
the release) is still running Android 2.0.1. I guess this is somewhat
out of laziness - I love the Incredible and its new (and more refined)
Android version and UI, but my phone is rooted. I'm not willing to give
up root, or any of my apps, and I have yet to find a tutorial for the
upgrade to 2.1 (or 2.2??) without losing root or my apps or data.

Anyway, I'm in North Carolina for the weekend and though the hotel
advertised free wifi, much as I feared, nobody bothered to do a site
survey or a real installation, and the signal level in my room is
useless (despite a pretty low noise floor). So after a little googling,
I managed to find the [Barnacle Wifi Tether][] ([Market link][] app.
Sure enough, it allows any Droid users with a rooted phone to setup an
ad-hoc wireless network for tethering without a custom kernel. In fact,
I'm writing this right now on my MacBook Pro tethered to my phone over
WiFi. I'm seeing 764Kbps down and 234Kbps up. Not enough for serious
work (forget my girlfriend's hope of playing Warcraft), but definitely
enough for email, web browsing and SSH on a much larger screen.

My only real complaints are that it's an ad-hoc network (which
apparently is a limitation of the Android WiFi driver for the phone), it
doesn't support anything better than WEP (so no online banking, and the
usual security concerns with what I'd equate to public open WiFi), and I
can't seem to figure out how to get the MAC ACL to work.

But given how little I travel, it's definitely a good app, a quick
install and setup, and a lot less complex than trying to get USB
tethering working when I eventually get Linux on the MBP.
