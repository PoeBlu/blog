After seeing a link to it on the [SAGE](http://www.sage.org) mailing
list, I happened to read Mark Dennehy'sblog post on [Tips for hiring new
engineers](http://www.stochasticgeometry.ie/2008/04/25/tips-for-hiring-new-engineers/).
I felt the need to make a few comments on some of his findings. Perhaps
someone in HR, or a recruiter, will actually read this and learn a thing
or two.

Unfortunately there are some places where this is required. In the
public sector, at least, the job ad and description set up fixed
guidelines. If you have a job description that doesn't include "plays
well with others", and the hire doesn't play well with others, it's
immensely difficult to fire them - the hire's failing wasn't listed in
the job description.

I have to whole-heartedly agree with what Mark said about writing
technical requirements. I don't know why HR seems to think that they can
write IT job descriptions - they wouldn't attempt it for most other
professionals. IT job descriptions should be left to IT people to write
- and, more importantly, people who actually understand what the person
will be doing.

Also a very good point. Even when I'm not actively looking for work, I
usually get a *lot* of phone calls and emails from recruiters.
Especially if I update my resume on one of the big job sites or post a
consulting ad on CraigsList, I get inundated with emails and phone calls
(which I usually refer to email, unless they're from a big player). I
can't possibly spend the hours to read and apply to all of them. The
first ones that get deleted are from people who obvously didn't even
look at my resume - entry-level (operator) positions, Windows admins,
anything with a primary duty that isn't even near my skill set (i.e.
they just used keyword matching and never read anything).

From there, I start looking through the descriptions and building two
lists - the ones that will likely get thrown out unless there's some
amazing thing that redeems them (i.e. a company that I really want to
work for) and the ones that I know I'll follow up on. Here are some of
the criteria I use:

**Likely to ignore:**

-   I read the job description and still can't figure out what I'd be
    doing.
-   The buzzword-to-content ratio is horrible.
-   The skills/requirements section lists every hot technology - a list
    that no human being can master.
-   The skills/requirements section has far too disparate of a list -
    something that only an engineer, administrator, programmer, and
    hardware designer could master.

**Follow-up:**

-   Use of the [SAGE Job
    Descriptions](http://www.sage.org/field/jobs-descriptions.html).
-   An actual salary range, not "varies with experience" or
    "competitive".
-   Some description of *where* I'll work - size of the team,
    responsibility, work environment, etc.
-   Examples of current things the team is working on, or examples of
    what I'd be working on.
-   Skills/requirements broken down into mandatory and
    optional/preferred.
-   A description that was obviously written by someone who understands
    the technology.

In closing, I have a theory for companies (especially those in the
public sector that have stringent HR/hiring policies) listing jobs in
the IT sector: have both HR and IT write portions of the job
description. Have HR write a paragraph or two with all of their
non-IT-specific stuff, and then have the IT hiring people (preferably
the manager the new hire will report to) write the rest. Put the HR
stuff at the bottom. Break the skills/requirements lists down into
"Technical Skills" (further divided into Required and
Preferred/Optional/Bonus) and a "Soft Skills" section for HR (with the
usual crap like "works with a team", "eligible for employment", etc.).

Everyone's up in arms about the recession, high unemployment, and low
job openings. Logic would dictate that it's an employer's market - and,
to a large extent, it is. However, that doesn't mean that employers
don't need to worry about making the advertisement attractive and
descriptive. Actually, I'd say it's the opposite - since I know that
there will likely be hundreds of other applicants, I only send a resume
in for jobs that I think I have a very good chance of getting. I'm sure
I've skipped over good positions just because the description didn't
communicate that to me - and I'm sure I'm not alone.
