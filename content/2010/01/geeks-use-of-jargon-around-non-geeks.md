In my daily reading of [Tom Limoncelli's blog][], I happened by a
[post][] with a link to an article, ["Geek behaviors present during
conversations" by Phillip Guo][]. The article is quite interesting, and
describes quite a few phenomena that can be noticed when conversing with
a [geek][]. One of the parts that immediately stuck out in my mind,
though, was:

While I'm definitely guilty of throwing jargon into explanations when
I'm at least half-conscious that the other party doesn't understand it,
I'd say that it's usually (for me and many who I know) for a different
reason. Or, more accurately, a combination of reasons that I'll call
"the expectation of effort" and "the Google effect". Firstly, among most
geeks (and definitely those of us in the open source world) there's an
expectation that people are interested, are curious, and will research
something that they don't know about when they hear it. The second part
is what I call "the Google effect"; most of us geeks do most of our
communication (especially about technical things) at a computer, whether
via email, IM, forums, or chat. Therefore, there's usually an
expectation that if someone doesn't understand a term, the answer is as
easy as Ctrl+T and typing the term into Google.

I also must take exception to one other item in the article:

> **Favoring complexity and detail over simplicity in descriptions**
>
> When a geek is describing his latest pet project, he often tries to
> make  
>  his descriptions sound complicated and detailed, in order to
> **convey  
>  the sophistication of his technical prowess**.

I've described plenty of my projects to plenty of people, and yes, my
descriptions are generally very detailed. But it's not out of any desire
to convey sophistication or prowess - my description may be the same
whether I'm telling it to someone who can't operate a computer or
someone of much greater skill than my own. It's simply the burning need
to be accurate and complete. Put as simply and generally as possible, if
I'm describing a project, I don't want whoever I'm talking to to ask
questions when I'm done describing it. It's like documentation - if I
were writing a man page, whoever reads it shouldn't be left with major
questions to ask when they finish.
