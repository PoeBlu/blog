And, most importantly... [Report: Linux Gains Ground, Windows
Stumbles][]. Apparently, according to Net Applications, Linux's market
share rose from 1 to 1.02 percent in December 2009, a small but hopeful
increase. Windows marketshare fell from 92.52% to 92.21%.

Like any statistic, there are always multiple sources. The
[W3Counter.com][] reports are a bit brighter for Linux:

If this is accurate, it shows Linux with a sifnigicant 1-month gain in
marketshare. Also notable is that in December, Android showed up for the
first time, at 0.08%. In all reasonabless, that can be added to the
Linux row.

Also of interest are W3Counter's browser stats:

Also worth noting on the Browser front is that IE8's market share rose
from 21.21% (November) to 22.43% (December) while Firefox 3.5's share
jumped from 20.49% in November to 22.18% in December, a very significant
stride for the brand new Firefox version. While IE8 has been out
considerably longer than Firefox 3.5, they're already almost tied in
market share (and if another jump like that happens, Firefox 3.5 will be
in the lead next month).
