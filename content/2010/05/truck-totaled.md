Since so many people seem to have missed all of the communications via
[facebook](http://www.facebook.com) (well, I can't blame them, I spend
less time there every time they make an "improvement"), I guess I should
give in and post something to my usually-so-professional blog,
explaining a bit about what happened to my
[beautiful](/2009/07/update-on-my-f-250-icom-mobile-antennas-strobes/)
[truck](/2009/02/truck-wiring-and-lighting-part-i/), which I'd put so
much [work](/2009/02/custom-truck-console/) into.

Two weeks ago - 08:43 on Saturday, May 1^st^, 2010 - I was involved in a
"bit" of an accident with my truck while driving down to my dad's place
in Hunterdon county. I was [on 208
Northbound](http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.017828,-74.217229&num=1&t=h&sll=41.018107,-74.218228&sspn=0.007026,0.016512&ie=UTF8&ll=41.017834,-74.217217&spn=0.007026,0.016512&z=17)
in Franklin Lakes right across from the Colonial Rd intersection (maybe
8 minutes from home?), early in the morning. I really don't have any
desire to tell the *whole detailed* story again, but bottom like: there
were three geese crossing the highway, and someone got the brilliant
idea to rapidly decelerate from 60 MPH to allow the birds to safely
cross. I still can't provide for the account of where every vehicle on
the road went, but there was a half-second of various drivers making
evasive maneuvers, me jamming on the brake and horn, and my truck having
a fast introduction to the ass-end of a box truck.

Luckily nobody was injured, though I did have neck pain for a day or two
after. The guy who decided to stop/cut left (in front of the box truck)
drove happily off into the sunrise, the guy in a blacked out SUV who had
been between the box truck and my vehicle (obscuring most of the truck
from my view) also, as far as I know, departed. Once I got the airbags
out of my way and the door kicked open, my former vehicle was on its way
to the body shop.

I must say, while I had an absolutely horrendous experience with
[geico](http://www.geico.com) when this same vehicle was stolen a year
and a half ago, they were actually pretty good this time around. The
accident happened on a Sunday, I took Monday off of work to get a rental
car and deal with the claim (yeah, it turns out my policy didn't have
the rental coverage, much to my surprise...) and the claims agent came
out Tuesday (less than 48 hours after the accident) to make an estimate.
He totaled the truck - the motor was even broken loose of all of the
mounts - and I had a check in my hand (minus the balance of the
financing) 12 days after the accident. So... my experience with Geico
this time around was much better. I guess as long as there's a vehicle
for them to look at, they're happy. Though I'm switching to Progressive
for the next vehicle.

So, that's the story. Assuming Enterprise car rental is playing nice,
I'll be picking up the truck I just bought tomorrow morning.
