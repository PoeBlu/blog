This site makes use of various third-party tools, including:

-   Google AdSense (for advertisements) - [Privacy Policy][], [Google Ad
    Privacy page][]
-   Google Analytics (for site stats) - [Google Privacy Policy][],
    [Google Analytics Privacy Page][]
-   A number of social sharing buttons at the bottom of each post
-   FeedBurner for my RSS/Atom feeds, also governed by the [Google
    Privacy Policy][]

These third party tools may perform tracking of your browsing, set
cookies, etc. Especially due to the Google Ads, I have little to no
control over what third-parties insert into page content. If you're
concerned, there are many good resources such as
[networkadvertising.org][] (which has a Consumer Opt-Out service) and
[The Electronic Frontier Foundation][].

I personally (as opposed to the third parties described above) use very
little visitor information. I do not disclose identifying information in
any way. I have access to Google Analytics, and retain server access
logs including IP address, user agent string, referrer, etc. (standard
combined log format). I use this only to track which content is the most
popular, what areas of the world my visitors are coming from, and
general site popularity. I rarely process the server access logs, but
occasionally do to try and get an idea of how many people have
javascript turned off or are otherwise missed by Google Analytics.
