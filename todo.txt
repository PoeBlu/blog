To Do:

- view on mobile
- preview on smaller screen, make sure category menu doesn't wrap over post title (something's using absolute positioning here??? css fix???)
- tag cloud should be an actual cloud, not a list
- disqus
- TWITTER_USERNAME didn't seem to do anything
- GITHUB_URL didn't seem to do anything
- SITESUBTITLE doesn't show up
- grep everything for "jasonantman.com", correct any bad/old absolute URLs
- grep for my other domains, correct and fix for redirects
- moderate comments on WP, then turn off commenting
- migrate comments to Disqus, figure out how to back up to this repo
- final WP post on migration to Pelican, then import here
- migrate any drafts from WP

Plugins:
- see https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-plugins and figure out how to manage them
  ideally, I probably want to pull them directly into this repo
