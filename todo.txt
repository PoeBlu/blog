= To Do

== Style / Template

1. blockquote style could be better (more like WP)

1. TWITTER_USERNAME didn't seem to do anything
1. GITHUB_URL didn't seem to do anything
1. SITESUBTITLE doesn't show up
1. twitter box/widget?

== Features

1. categories and tags - check URLs/paths
1. feeds
1. Google Analytics
1. sitemap

== Content

1. HTML table in
  * new-web-server-wp-optimization
  * interesting-links-for-tuesday-january-26th-2010
1. grep everything for "jasonantman.com", correct any bad/old absolute URLs
1. grep for my other domains, correct and fix for redirects
1. grep content for "<span" "span>" "<p" and "p>"
