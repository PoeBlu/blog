To Do:

- tag cloud should be an actual cloud, not a list
- TWITTER_USERNAME didn't seem to do anything
- GITHUB_URL didn't seem to do anything
- SITESUBTITLE doesn't show up
- search for any/all broken links (incl. off-site)
- grep everything for "jasonantman.com", correct any bad/old absolute URLs
- grep for my other domains, correct and fix for redirects
- categories and tags - check URLs/paths
- feeds
- Google Analytics
- sitemap
- twitter box/widget?
- validate HTML, CSS, feeds
- include code snippet plugin, to include highlighted code snippets (use for GH snippets???)
- grep content for "<span" "span>" "<p" and "p>"
- blockquote style could be better (more like WP)
- {.console} doesn't seem colored right
- grep output for \s+::: or ~~~
- HTML table in
  - new-web-server-wp-optimization
  - interesting-links-for-tuesday-january-26th-2010
- image links on
  - update-on-my-f-250-icom-mobile-antennas-strobes
- grep for all images, make sure they're in the blog repo
