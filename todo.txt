1. validate CSS, feeds, HTML

1. reimplement https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-plugins/tree/master/github_activity
   using https://github.com/grasuth/github-activity or similar JS library
1. w3c mobileOK checker
1. Grep for wiki.jasonantman.com and jasonantman.com/wiki - want static pages for anything linked. (or just make static mediawiki???)
