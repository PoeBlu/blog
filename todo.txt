To Do:

- view on mobile
- preview on smaller screen, make sure category menu doesn't wrap over post title (something's using absolute positioning here??? css fix???)
- tag cloud should be an actual cloud, not a list
- github
- disqus
- TWITTER_USERNAME didn't seem to do anything
- GITHUB_URL didn't seem to do anything
- SITESUBTITLE doesn't show up
-
