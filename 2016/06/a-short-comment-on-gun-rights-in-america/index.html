                <p>This blog has, for many years, been unabashedly &#8220;all tech.&#8221; I&#8217;ve often had second thoughts about that, wondering if I should give the rest of my self - my political, moral and ethical views - more of a voice. But I&#8217;ve always put that aside - partially because this <em>always</em> comes up when I&#8217;m looking for a new job and I don&#8217;t really want to be remembered as that guy with the strongly disagreeing views, partially because I don&#8217;t want people looking for technical content to be frustrated by my rants. And partially because it&#8217;s just harder for me to convey political or social concepts in the way I intend than it is to convey technical ones. But after the events of the past 36 hours - and moreover, of the past decade-plus - I&#8217;m going to deviate from that. <strong>Be advised</strong> that if you have strong feelings on either side of the gun control debate, this probably isn&#8217;t going to make you&nbsp;happy.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a gun owner. I have been since my eighteenth birthday, the day when I became legally able to exercise my second amendment rights in my then-home state of New Jersey. That was only a decade ago, but the impact of guns on America seems so shockingly different. I own a single .22-caliber target pistol; certainly dangerous as any firearm is, but essentially the bottom of the scale when it comes to lethality. It&#8217;s designed to shoot paper, not much else. I&#8217;ve been shooting off and on since I was in my early teens, mostly handguns and shotguns. Apparently unlike most people who are vocal gun owners, I&#8217;ve never fired a shot at anything that is or was ever alive, unless you count paper. I&#8217;ve never fired a shot outside of a shooting&nbsp;range.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve also never carried a gun in public, nor have I ever had a serious desire to. Despite what gun-rights activists claim about self-defense and defense of others, I think that the way police in this country are both trained and act in the field is a wonderful example of why firearm carry in public often doesn&#8217;t work: we&#8217;re talking about people whose <em>profession</em> involves firearms, who must train and qualify with their guns annually (or more often), and still often can&#8217;t hit a target in a real-life situation. As far as I&#8217;m concerned, if someone wants to carry a firearm to defend themselves or others, they damn well better be shooting <em>every day</em>, doing live-fire training, and completely confident that they could identify and hit a target in real life. To my knowledge, only the most elite units of the military do this. I grew up in New Jersey, where the only people who carry guns are law enforcement and criminals, period (<span class="caps">OK</span>, there are some <em>extremely</em> rare exceptions). I now live in Georgia, where anyone can walk into WalMart and walk out with a gun - and many people walk around the store with handguns on their belts, something that&#8217;s still foreign to&nbsp;me.</p>
<p>On my eighteenth birthday, I went to the police department in my home town to begin the process of purchasing the target pistol that my father had offered as a gift. For those of you who aren&#8217;t familiar with how gun (specifically handgun - it&#8217;s significantly easier for shotguns and rifles) ownership works in the northeast, here&#8217;s the gist of it (my memory may be a bit hazy, and some of it may have been explained&nbsp;poorly):</p>
<ol>
<li>I went to the police department and met with the chief, whom I already knew personally through&nbsp;family.</li>
<li>I paid a fee of approximately $100 and filled out about six pages of paperwork, including a full history of my addresses and a lengthy&nbsp;questionnaire.</li>
<li>I was fingerprinted - all ten fingers, three sets of&nbsp;prints.</li>
<li>I filled out consent forms for federal and state background checks and consents for mental health records&nbsp;searches.</li>
<li>These were all sent out to the respective&nbsp;agencies.</li>
<li>About a month later, the chief called to tell me that he&#8217;d received the replies from the federal and state governments, and they came back <span class="caps">OK</span> (which is to be expected, as I had no mental health history and no criminal&nbsp;record).</li>
<li>He then sent out form letters to the three non-related character references I had specified on my application, requesting them to assert under penalty of perjury whether they believed that I posed any danger to myself or others, if I were allowed to purchase a&nbsp;firearm.</li>
<li>The letters were all returned by my references. The chief then sent the completed paperwork back to the state government, which issued me a state firearms purchaser identification card, entitling me to purchase firearms and ammunition. I was also issued - as requested - a Permit to Purchase a Handgun, which entitled me to purchase one (1) handgun within 90 days of the date of&nbsp;issue.</li>
</ol>
<p><span class="caps">OK</span>, so that&#8217;s quite a process. All in all, it took two or three months to&nbsp;complete.</p>
<p>When I finally received my <span class="caps">ID</span> card and permit - which had to be picked up in person - I headed out to a local gun store to find the model I wanted. And I did. I turned the purchase permit over to the salesperson, who called the state government to verify its validity. We finalized the details of the transaction and I inspected the merchandise and filled out some last paperwork. The gun I&#8217;d purchased was then marked with a &#8220;sold&#8221; sticker and had a copy of the invoice attached, and was locked in a safe for me to pick up in seven days, when the mandatory waiting period was over. When I returned a week later, one of the two spent cartridges from the gun (shipped with it by the manufacturer) was sent to the state police for future forensic&nbsp;use.</p>
<p>New Jersey is widely regarded as having some of the strictest gun control laws in the country. And none of that is enough. There was never a follow-up. There was no ongoing monitoring that I&#8217;m aware of. I&#8217;ve heard more stories than I can remember of people being convicted of crimes or involved in domestic violence situations, and then using their legally-purchased and registered firearms in future crimes. It makes no sense to me that we live in a world where Amazon knows what items I&#8217;m interested in today, but the authorities can&#8217;t figure out to take my gun away if I assault someone. There was also never a mandatory proficiency or safety test, either written or at a real firing&nbsp;range.</p>
<p>How is it that we live in a country where operation of a motor vehicle - a device which <em>can</em> be fatal when operated improperly - requires a written examination, a practical demonstration of skill, and an ongoing demonstration of responsibility (traffic police), but the possession and operation of a firearm does not? It makes no sense. I don&#8217;t want to minimize the effects of poor driving decisions, they certainly claim many lives, but there&#8217;s no avoiding the fact that firearms were - and in many cases, are - <em>designed</em> to&nbsp;kill.</p>
<p>I suppose that most of my feelings on this are based on two of my core beliefs, which run contrary to many gun-rights activists: (1) that my only use for a firearm is target shooting, and it doesn&#8217;t really matter to me how quickly I can buy one, and (2) that our military has tanks and nukes, and the idea of &#8220;defending my Freedom [against a government takeover]&#8221; with any legally-purchased weapon is impossible, regardless of whether or not it&#8217;s simply&nbsp;paranoid.</p>
<p>Whether openly or not, many gun rights activists base their positions on a romanticized fictional &#8220;past America&#8221;, where everyone was good, owned guns, defended themselves, and was self-sufficient. Even if that past world existed (in reality it was quite violent; the violence just isn&#8217;t remembered in the Utopian narrative), it&#8217;s certainly not today. The past America they speak of was a time when most gun owners had been so since childhood (it was merely a part of living), likely had many fewer violent influences, and could count on swift justice. Let&#8217;s also remember the technology of this past age: I might be <span class="caps">OK</span> with gun rights activists going back to this mythical past, if they also could only have a six-shot revolver that takes a few minutes to&nbsp;reload.</p>
<p>But despite what gun rights activists try to tell us, the problem here is not hardcore criminals. It&#8217;s people who may or may not have criminal or suspicious pasts, who decide to act on their violent ideas. It&#8217;s people who can walk into a store and buy a weapon or magazine that holds twenty or fifty rounds of ammunition - something which has no legitimate use other than mass killing. It&#8217;s people who can borrow or steal guns from family or friends, because those firearms weren&#8217;t treated with the proper respect and safety by their legal owners. It&#8217;s the belief by some that there&#8217;s a legitimate reason to obtain a gun in less than a week, or a month, or months. It&#8217;s the ironic dichotomy of the people who believe that Snowden was a traitor and mass surveillance is fine, but registering guns is an unconstitutional invasion of privacy. And it has to stop. I dare say, if every mass shooting in the past decade or two was carried out by a Muslim or an immigrant or anyone other than a white Christian, half of the roadblocks to a safe America would&#8217;ve&nbsp;disappeared.</p>
<p>To everyone who takes a literal reading of the Constitution and says that the second amendment grants every American the right to posses and carry as many and whatever kind of firearms they want, I make three&nbsp;comments:</p>
<ol>
<li><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>falsely shouting &#8216;fire&#8217; in a crowded theater.&#8221; We have a Supreme Court for a reason: that the framers knew the Constitution would have to be interpreted differently with&nbsp;time.</li>
<li>If you stand against gun registration or regulation, please keep in mind that your precious second amendment begins with the phrase, &#8220;A well regulated Militia.&#8221; Even if you don&#8217;t believe that this is equivalent to a modern-day standing army, it clearly does <em>not</em> say, &#8220;Everybody gets all the firearms they want,&nbsp;period.&#8221;</li>
<li><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.&#8221; They weren&#8217;t put in that order by&nbsp;mistake.</li>
</ol>
