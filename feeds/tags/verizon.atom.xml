didn&amp;#8217;t work the way I&amp;#8217;d hoped. When I woke up this morning (December
10&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; 2009) I had an alert dialog on screen telling me that an update
was ready. It gave me three options: &amp;#8220;Install Now&amp;#8221;, &amp;#8220;Install Later&amp;#8221; and
&amp;#8220;More Info&amp;#8221;. The More Info screen didn&amp;#8217;t show me anything useful. Well,
I clicked the &amp;#8220;Later&amp;#8221; option, figuring that when I got home tonight I&amp;#8217;d
turn on WiFi, do a packet capture on the router, and save all of the
traffic (specifically including the name of the update server). Well, it
kept reminding me all day at annoyingly short intervals - probably about
every 10 minutes or so. Finally, when I was home and had the WiFi setup,
I went to try it again and&amp;#8230; yup&amp;#8230; when I clicked on the &amp;#8220;System
Update&amp;#8221; button in Settings, the only option I had was &amp;#8220;Reboot and&amp;nbsp;Install&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So&amp;#8230; first big bitch about the Droid&amp;#8230; Verizon pushed out the update
without my consent. I kept hitting &amp;#8220;Later&amp;#8221; because that was the only way
to get the popup to go away. Apparently. after X times of hitting Later
(and each time your only real options are Later or Now) it will download
the update by itself. Once the update is downloaded, I&amp;#8217;m assuming that
it &lt;em&gt;may&lt;/em&gt; just automatically install on the next reboot. That would be
a bitch thing to&amp;nbsp;do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the &amp;#8220;More Info&amp;#8221; screen, which provides (as far as I can tell)
the only release notes for the update,&amp;nbsp;states:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This software update includes enhancements to your &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DROID&lt;/span&gt; by Motorola.
Approximate install time: 6-10 Mins. You will be unable to use your
device or make emergency calls for the duration of the install. The
software updates automatically, and your &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DROID&lt;/span&gt; will power off and on
as part of this software update. For more information please visit:
&lt;a href="www.verizonwireless.com/droidsupport"&gt;www.verizonwireless.com/droidsupport&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not too helpful. And pretty&amp;nbsp;cryptic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Immediately when the phone turned back on, the first thing I noticed is
that the spin-style unlock button has been replaced with an iPhone-style
slide button, and the same for the mute feature. Maybe it&amp;#8217;s just me, but
I also noticed that the on screen keyboard seems to react better to
quick keypresses - perhaps they&amp;#8217;ve enabled multitouch for&amp;nbsp;this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I wasn&amp;#8217;t able to find much release documentation from
Google other than the &lt;a href="http://developer.android.com/sdk/android-2.0.1.html"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt;
changes&lt;/a&gt; - no full
release notes or changelog like I&amp;#8217;d like. And not even a summary of
changes that I could&amp;nbsp;find.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VZW&lt;/span&gt; droid support site, I found a &lt;a href="http://learning.verizonwireless.com/learning/Droid_Motorola_Software_Update.pdf"&gt;link to a
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PDF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
of &amp;#8220;Why to Update&amp;#8221; (&lt;a href="/GFX/Droid_Motorola_Software_Update.pdf"&gt;local
copy&lt;/a&gt;).
This sheet lists the enhancements made by the update
(&amp;#8220;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AP&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ESD56&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;BP&lt;/span&gt;:C_01.3E.01P&amp;#8221;, build &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ESD56&lt;/span&gt;)&amp;nbsp;as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;OS&lt;/span&gt; stability is&amp;nbsp;improved.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Battery life is&amp;nbsp;improved.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Camera auto focus functionality is improved, and time between shots
    is&amp;nbsp;reduced.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enhancements for three-way&amp;nbsp;calling.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Audio for incoming calls is&amp;nbsp;improved.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When receiving a call on call waiting, the speakerphone now remains&amp;nbsp;on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bluetooth functionality is improved; background echo is&amp;nbsp;eliminated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improved Bluetooth phone book transfer of contacts to in-vehicle
    Bluetooth&amp;nbsp;solutions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After closing a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPS&lt;/span&gt; application, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPS&lt;/span&gt; icon will now automatically
    be removed from the notification&amp;nbsp;panel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Users can now receive &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SMS&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MMS&lt;/span&gt; messages after an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EMS&lt;/span&gt; message is&amp;nbsp;received.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SMS&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MMS&lt;/span&gt; may now be sent to seven-digit&amp;nbsp;addresses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google contact merging has been updated to accommodate seven-digit&amp;nbsp;numbers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Visual Voice Mail notices now arrive&amp;nbsp;instantaneously.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The corporate calendar widget user interface is&amp;nbsp;updated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tiny one-page (and very styish - looks like and in-store
advertising piece) sheet obviously isn&amp;#8217;t anything that could pass for
release notes, especially from Google. It doesn&amp;#8217;t even mention anything
about the changed unlock&amp;nbsp;button!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ll keep looking around to find a real feature summary/release
notes/changelog, but here&amp;#8217;s my running list (I&amp;#8217;ll update) of what I&amp;#8217;ve&amp;nbsp;found:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Changed the unlock slider to a straight&amp;nbsp;line.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On screen keyboard typing seems&amp;nbsp;faster.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Photo taking &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; considerably faster, though it&amp;#8217;s still painfully
    slow - it used to take about 10 seconds from shutter button to ready
    to capture next image, it&amp;#8217;s now about 5&amp;nbsp;seconds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UI&lt;/span&gt; seems to be a bit more responsive&amp;nbsp;overall.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I haven&amp;#8217;t checked yet, but I&amp;#8217;ve seen some forum posts about lost
    contacts and Facebook sync&amp;nbsp;issues.&lt;/li&gt;

700p&lt;/a&gt; to record
phone calls. About a month or two ago, I had some issues with my phone
and had to call Verizon Wireless. The poor woman was trying to open a
ticket for me, but said that she was having some problems, as they were
moving from one ticketing system to another, she was having some issues
with the new one, and the old one was down at her&amp;nbsp;location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As she waited for a rep from another location to come on the line and
enter the ticket, I happened to remark that I work in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IT&lt;/span&gt; and had been
doing some work with them (&lt;a href="http://eventum.mysql.com"&gt;Eventum&lt;/a&gt;) lately.
She mentioned that the old one was a proprietary system, but asked if
I&amp;#8217;d ever heard of &lt;a href="http://www.mantisbt.org/"&gt;Mantis&lt;/a&gt;. Of course, I said
that I had. And was then asked if I knew much about it, and whether I
might know what the problem she was having was caused by. Unfortunately,
I had to say no, as I&amp;#8217;d never used it for more than a few minutes. But I
did get to confirm that a company as large and closed (they won&amp;#8217;t
support Linux, their phones run closed &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OS&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s, and they block my port 80)
as Verizon is happily transitioning from closed-source proprietary
software to a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPL&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;d alternative. I also got another item to add to my
list of telephone tech support people who have asked me (the customer)
for&amp;nbsp;support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I don&amp;#8217;t see Verizon listed on the list of &lt;a href="http://www.mantisbt.org/directory.php"&gt;known Mantis
users&lt;/a&gt;, so I have no way to fully
confirm&amp;nbsp;this.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="mantis"></category><category term="ticketing"></category><category term="verizon"></category></entry><entry><title>Links, Update on next month</title><link href="https://blog.jasonantman.com/2007/12/links-update-on-next-month/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2007-12-25T19:42:00-05:00</published><updated>2007-12-25T19:42:00-05:00</updated><author><name>admin</name></author><id>tag:blog.jasonantman.com,2007-12-25:/2007/12/links-update-on-next-month/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;So, the semester is finally over.

And aside from a trip to Maryland for five or six days, I&amp;#8217;m home until
the 20th of January. That&amp;#8217;s lots of time to spend running calls for the
&lt;a href="http://www.midlandparkambulance.com/"&gt;Midland Park (Volunteer) Ambulance
Corps&lt;/a&gt;, here in my home town of
Midland Park, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NJ&lt;/span&gt;, with which I&amp;#8217;ve been volunteering as an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EMT&lt;/span&gt;-B for
almost four years now. So far, in the past 24 hours (Christmas Eve and
Christmas Day, I&amp;#8217;ve done 3 runs, which is above average for us - usually
about 1.75/day). It&amp;#8217;s also a lot of time to spend on some projects of&amp;nbsp;mine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve already setup one of the SunBlade 150 machines as a desktop, and
had to handle a lot of networking stuff (see the &lt;a href="http://www.jasonantman.com/wiki/index.php/Solaris_Tips"&gt;Solaris
Tips&lt;/a&gt; page on my
&lt;a href="http://www.jasonantman.com"&gt;Wiki&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other news, after getting some Christmas and Chanukah (yes, my
father&amp;#8217;s family is Jewish, and I&amp;#8217;ve yet to find out a single accepted
spelling for the holiday) money, I ran out to a Verizon store and picked
up the phone I&amp;#8217;ve been dreaming of for months - a beautiful &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NEW&lt;/span&gt; (my
first not-used phone in 6 years) Treo 700p. So far, aside from some
problems with the Chatter Email software (to my dismay, I can&amp;#8217;t find a
free (even as in cost, let alone as in freedom, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IMAP&lt;/span&gt; client for Palm)
and problems deciding whether or not to pay $25/month for data, I love
it. I still need to deal with Verizon, as they wouldn&amp;#8217;t let me activate
the phone without a data plan, and the current $45/month &amp;#8220;unlimited&amp;#8221;
plan is a bit much for&amp;nbsp;me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I have a few big projects planned for the upcoming down&amp;nbsp;time:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Setup my other SunBlade as a mail server running Postfix, Procmail,
    SpamAssassin (with Pyzor or Razor), an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IMAP&lt;/span&gt; server, and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SSL&lt;/span&gt; for&amp;nbsp;everything.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Setup a Soekris box as a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WAP&lt;/span&gt; here at&amp;nbsp;home.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get Chatter Email on the Treo working right with folders (Maildir)
    on my &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IMAP&lt;/span&gt; (Dovecot)&amp;nbsp;server.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Port my GnuPG/Java-based password manager application to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;J2ME&lt;/span&gt; on the
    Treo, and figure out how to sync the databases (just GnuPG-encrypted
    flat files). Also, port it to my Nokia 770&amp;nbsp;Tablet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get my Bluetooth Keyboard (an iGo Ultra Slim) working with the 770 -
    right now, the &lt;a href="http://770.fs-security.com/maemo-bt-plugin/"&gt;Bluetooth
    Plugin&lt;/a&gt; crashes the
    unit after typing a few&amp;nbsp;characters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do a bunch of overhauling on the website, especially generating
    sitemaps (big issue when you have static content, MediaWiki, and
    source code) and submitting my &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CVS&lt;/span&gt; repo to Google Code&amp;nbsp;Search.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, A few &lt;strong&gt;Links&lt;/strong&gt; for your
enjoyment:
A &lt;a href="http://pogue.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/12/20/the-generational-divide-in-copyright-morality/"&gt;New York Times
blog&lt;/a&gt;
by David Pogue talking about &amp;#8220;intellectual property&amp;#8221;, &amp;#8220;copyright
morality&amp;#8221;, etc. He even goes so far as to imply that making a single
backup copy of a legally purchased &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DVD&lt;/span&gt; is&amp;nbsp;illegal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20071211055139790&amp;amp;mode=nested"&gt;Groklaw
article&lt;/a&gt;
on the February &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISO&lt;/span&gt; Ballot Resolution Meeting on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MSOOXML&lt;/span&gt;. If you&amp;#8217;re not
familiar with it, check out &lt;a href="http://www.noooxml.org/"&gt;noOOXML.org&lt;/a&gt; and
their &lt;a href="http://www.noooxml.org/petition"&gt;petition&lt;/a&gt; listing the reasons to
vote &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NO&lt;/span&gt; on the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OOXML&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;ballot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/asiapcf/12/03/eco.myth.ewaste/index.html"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CNN&lt;/span&gt;
article&lt;/a&gt;
stating that it&amp;#8217;s true that &amp;#8220;Switching from a Windows-operated computer
to a Linux-operated one could slash computer-generated e-waste levels by&amp;nbsp;50%.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Register - &lt;a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/security/security_report_windows_vs_linux/"&gt;Windows vs. Linux Security
Report&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some interesting Earthlink (yes, apparently they still exist)
newsletters talking about &lt;a href="http://www.earthlink.net/elink/issue136/infocus.html"&gt;Linux for the
