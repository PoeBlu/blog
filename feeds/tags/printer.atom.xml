&lt;span class="caps"&gt;HL&lt;/span&gt;-2170W&lt;/a&gt;
that I got for my mother. It seemed absolutely wonderful. Until the
night of March 31st, just before Conficker was supposed to strike. Being
that mom&amp;#8217;s computer is the only one at home running Windows, I finished
up a long-standing project - and moved her desktop, printer, and AppleTV
over to a separate &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VLAN&lt;/span&gt; that&amp;#8217;s not routable to anything else internal
(i.e. anything important, or anything of mine). I&amp;#8217;d already had the
&amp;#8220;client&amp;#8221; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VLAN&lt;/span&gt; setup for a while, so it was just a matter of tweaking the
firewall rules and moving the static &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DHCP&lt;/span&gt; assignments from one subnet to
the&amp;nbsp;other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, that&amp;#8217;s where the problems started. While her Windows &lt;span class="caps"&gt;XP&lt;/span&gt; desktop
and AppleTV coped nicely, and got their new addresses in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DHCP&lt;/span&gt; as they
should, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HL2170W&lt;/span&gt; did not, As a matter of fact, after two hours, I
hadn&amp;#8217;t seen a single &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DHCP&lt;/span&gt; request, even though I had the lease time set
to 10 minutes for both subnets. So, I tried administratively downing the
switch port a few times, to no avail. After a day of waiting, I came
back to the problem - and &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; found nothing in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DHCP&lt;/span&gt; logs from
that printer. I emailed mom and asked her to power-cycle it a few
times&amp;#8230; still nothing! It wasn&amp;#8217;t even requesting &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DHCP&lt;/span&gt; when rolled, let
alone at a regular&amp;nbsp;interval!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast forward a week or so, to today. I&amp;#8217;m ready to call Brother Support,
as my mother hasn&amp;#8217;t had use of her new printer in a week and a half. I&amp;#8217;m
infuriated - I&amp;#8217;ve rolled the printer dozens of times, and not a single
event in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DHCP&lt;/span&gt; log. I know it&amp;#8217;s sending traffic from the port - I&amp;#8217;ve
reset the counters and they&amp;#8217;re changing. I tried moving it back to the
original &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VLAN&lt;/span&gt; and confirmed that it still has its&amp;#8217; original &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IP&lt;/span&gt;. I could
get into the web interface via &lt;a href="http://lynx.isc.org/"&gt;lynx&lt;/a&gt; and *tell
it* to refresh &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DHCP&lt;/span&gt;, but this seemed quite pointless - there&amp;#8217;s no way
it&amp;#8217;s physically possible to send the web request and then switch the
port to the new &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VLAN&lt;/span&gt; before it gets&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DHCP&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I&amp;#8217;m ready to call Brother Support. I then notice that the printer is
turned off at the moment. From the switch log, it looks as though it&amp;#8217;s
been powered off for six days. So, I turn it on. And then go about
starting my prep for the Brother call, first opening up a tail on the
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DHCP&lt;/span&gt; server log, grepped for the proper interface. And, wouldn&amp;#8217;t you
know, as I get up to let the dog out, the printer starts spitting out&amp;nbsp;pages!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as I can tell, there&amp;#8217;s something &lt;em&gt;seriously wrong&lt;/em&gt; with the
Brother &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HL&lt;/span&gt;-2170W &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DHCP&lt;/span&gt; implementation. Specifically, it didn&amp;#8217;t get an
address on the new &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VLAN&lt;/span&gt; until it was powered off for a *long* time.
Even reboots wouldn&amp;#8217;t trigger a request, until the box had been powered
off for &lt;em&gt;days&lt;/em&gt;. More importantly, though, it seems that it only gets
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DHCP&lt;/span&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;once&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; when it boots, and totally disregards the lease&amp;nbsp;time!&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="dhcp"></category><category term="hl2170w"></category><category term="printer"></category><category term="vlan"></category></entry><entry><title>Brother HL-2170W - great features from a personal laser printer</title><link href="http://newblog.jasonantman.com/2009/03/brother-hl-2170w-great-features-from-a-personal-laser-printer/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2009-03-18T21:29:00-04:00</updated><author><name>admin</name></author><id>tag:newblog.jasonantman.com,2009-03-18:2009/03/brother-hl-2170w-great-features-from-a-personal-laser-printer/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve posted an &lt;a href="/2009/04/brother-hl2170w-dhcp-problems/"&gt;update about serious &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DHCP&lt;/span&gt; problems with this
unit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week my mother&amp;#8217;s printer died, and she asked me to find a new one
for her. After a quick look on &lt;a href="http://www.newegg.com"&gt;NewEgg&lt;/a&gt; (sort by
ratings is a wonderful thing) I found the &lt;a href="http://www.brother-usa.com/Printer/ModelDetail.aspx?ProductID=hl2170W"&gt;Brother
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;HL&lt;/span&gt;-2170W&lt;/a&gt;.
Aside from having a wireless interface (only a security hole, as far as
I&amp;#8217;m concerned) it seemed pretty cool - tiny B&amp;amp;W laser, Ethernet, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PCL6&lt;/span&gt;,
23ppm, 32 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MB&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RAM&lt;/span&gt;, 250 sheet capacity and 2400x600 dpi. So, for a mere
$99 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USD&lt;/span&gt;, I bought it for&amp;nbsp;her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the printer showed up, I was a bit let down to find no sticker
bearing the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MAC&lt;/span&gt; address on either the box or the printer itself - and
given the one-button hard control, there wasn&amp;#8217;t a way to manually print
a config sheet. So, after plugging it into the network and using the
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DHCP&lt;/span&gt; logs to give it a static assignment, a quick reboot of the printer
had everything working. As usual, I skipped to the last few pages in the
installation manual, and found the ½ page section on the web interface.
Configuration was pretty simple - change the admin password, disable a
bunch of unneeded services, etc. And then, when playing around with the
admin interface, I found a bit of a holy grail - there in the
enable/disable services screen were two options that I found unusual for
a &amp;#8220;personal&amp;#8221; printer; &lt;strong&gt;Telnet&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SNMP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. I immediately tried both.
An snmpwalk revealed the usual (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;RFC1213&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HOST&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;RESOURCES&lt;/span&gt;, and
Printer-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;MIB&lt;/span&gt;) including information on status and consumables. Though the
Telnet login process wasn&amp;#8217;t terribly intuitive, &amp;#8220;help&amp;#8221; revealed familiar
set/show/clear functionality as well as an option to zero out counters.
While I was a bit let down to see that there wasn&amp;#8217;t a way to view
consumable status or printer status, it did allow access to every
conceivable configuration parameter, including a few that weren&amp;#8217;t
mentioned on the web&amp;nbsp;interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, while I can&amp;#8217;t comment about reliability or quality yet, this
cute little printer seems to have quite a feature set, especially when
it comes to manageability and remote troubleshooting (a good thing for
any printer that&amp;#8217;s used by a family member who you support). And best of
all, it supports &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IPP&lt;/span&gt; and&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;LPR&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="printer"></category><category term="review"></category></entry></feed>
