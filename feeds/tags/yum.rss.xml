ago that I&amp;#8217;m just getting around to publishing. Unfortunately, I have
yet to find a build system that meets my requirements (see the last&amp;nbsp;paragraph).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At work, we have a handful - currently a really small number - of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RPM&lt;/span&gt;
packages that we need to build and deploy internally for our CentOS
server infrastructure. A number of them are just pulled down from
specific third-party repositories and rebuilt to have the vendor set as
us, and some are internally patched or developed software. We run
websites, and on the product side, we&amp;#8217;re a
Python/&lt;a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/"&gt;Django&lt;/a&gt; shop (in fact, probably
one of the largest Django apps out there). We don&amp;#8217;t deploy our Django
apps via &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RPM&lt;/span&gt;, so building and distributing RPMs is definitely not one of
our core competencies. In fact, we really only want to do it when we&amp;#8217;re
testing/deploying a new distro, or when an upstream package is&amp;nbsp;updated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week I pulled a ticket to deploy &lt;a href="http://nodejs.org/"&gt;node.js&lt;/a&gt; to
one of our build hosts, and we&amp;#8217;ve got a few things in the pipeline that
also rely on it. I found the
&lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-nodejs"&gt;puppetlabs-nodejs&lt;/a&gt;
module on Github that&amp;#8217;s supposed to install it on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RHEL&lt;/span&gt;/CentOS, but it
pulls packages from
&lt;a href="http://patches.fedorapeople.org/oldnode/stable/"&gt;http://patches.fedorapeople.org/oldnode/stable/&lt;/a&gt;,
and the newest version of nodejs there is 0.6.18, which is quite old. I
can&amp;#8217;t find any actively maintained sources of newer nodejs packages for
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;RHEL&lt;/span&gt;/CentOS (yeah, I know, that&amp;#8217;s one down side to the
distributions&amp;#8230;). However, I did find that nodejs 0.9.5 is being &lt;a href="http://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/packageinfo?packageID=15154"&gt;built
for Fedora 18/19 in the Fedora build
system&lt;/a&gt;,
is already in the Fedora 18 Testing and Fedora Rawhide repos, but is
failing its &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EL6&lt;/span&gt; builds in their system. The decision I&amp;#8217;ve come to is to
use the puppetlabs-nodejs module to install it, but try and rebuild the
Fedora 18 RPMs under CentOS 5 and&amp;nbsp;6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that&amp;#8217;s the background. Now, my current task: to search for an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RPM&lt;/span&gt;
build system for my current job. My core requirements, in no specific
order,&amp;nbsp;are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be relatively easy and quick to use for people who have a specfile
    or &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SRPM&lt;/span&gt; and want to be able to &amp;#8220;ensure =&gt; present&amp;#8221; the finished &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RPM&lt;/span&gt;
    on a system. i.e., require as little per-package configuration as&amp;nbsp;possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be able to handle rebuilding &amp;#8220;all&amp;#8221; of our RPMs when we roll out a
    new distro version. Doesn&amp;#8217;t necessarily need to be automatic, but
    should be relatively&amp;nbsp;simple.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ideally, not need to be running constantly - i.e. something that
    will cope well with build hosts being VMs that are shut down when
    they&amp;#8217;re not&amp;nbsp;needed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Handle automatically putting successfully built packages into a
    repository, ideally with some sort of (manual) promotion process
    from staging to&amp;nbsp;stable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have minimal external (infrastructure) dependencies that we can&amp;#8217;t
    satisfy with existing&amp;nbsp;systems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, the first step was to research existing &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RPM&lt;/span&gt; build systems and how
others do this. Here&amp;#8217;s a list of what I could find online, though most
of these are from distributions and software vendors/projects, not
end-user companies that are only building for internal&amp;nbsp;use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://fedorahosted.org/koji/wiki"&gt;Koji&lt;/a&gt; is the build system used
    by &lt;a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Koji"&gt;Fedora&lt;/a&gt; and RedHat. It&amp;#8217;s
    about as full-featured as any can be, and I&amp;#8217;m familiar with it from
    my time at &lt;a href="http://koji.rutgers.edu/koji/"&gt;Rutgers University&lt;/a&gt;, as
    it&amp;#8217;s used to maintain their CentOS/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;RHEL&lt;/span&gt; packages. It&amp;#8217;s based largely
    on Mock. However, &lt;a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Koji/ServerHowTo"&gt;setting up the build
    server&lt;/a&gt; is no
    trivial task; there are few installations outside of Fedora/RedHat,
    and it relies on either Kerberos or an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SSL&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CA&lt;/span&gt; infrastructure to
    authenticate machines and clients. So, it&amp;#8217;s designed for too large a
    scale and too much infrastructure for&amp;nbsp;me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PLD&lt;/span&gt; Linux has a &lt;a href="https://www.pld-linux.org/developingpld/builderscript"&gt;builder
    script&lt;/a&gt; that
    seems to automate &lt;code&gt;rpmbuild&lt;/code&gt; as well as fetching sources and
    resolving/building dependencies. I haven&amp;#8217;t looked at the script yet,
    but apparently it&amp;#8217;s in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PLD&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;rpm-build-tools&amp;#8221;&amp;nbsp;package.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PLD&lt;/span&gt; Linux also has a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CVS&lt;/span&gt; repository for something called
    &lt;a href="http://cvs.pld-linux.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/pld-builder.new"&gt;pld-builder.new&lt;/a&gt;.
    The
    &lt;a href="http://cvs.pld-linux.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/pld-builder.new/doc/README?rev=1.5"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;README&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    and
    &lt;a href="http://cvs.pld-linux.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/pld-builder.new/doc/ARCHITECTURE?rev=1.6"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ARCHITECTURE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    files make it sound like a relatively simple mainly-Python system
    that builds &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SRPMS&lt;/span&gt; and binary packages when requested, and most
    importantly, seems like a simple system that uses little more than
    shared filesystem access for communication and&amp;nbsp;coordination.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ALT&lt;/span&gt; Linux has &lt;a href="http://en.altlinux.org/Sisyphus"&gt;Sisyphus&lt;/a&gt;, which
    combines repository management and web interface tools, package
    building and testing tools, and&amp;nbsp;more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Dries &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RPM&lt;/span&gt; repository uses (or at least used&amp;#8230; my reference is
    quite old) &lt;a href="http://dries.ulyssis.org/rpm/pydar2/index.html"&gt;pydar2&lt;/a&gt;,
    &amp;#8220;a distributed client/server program which allows you to build
    multiple spec files on multiple distribution/architecture
    combinations automatically.&amp;#8221; That sounds like it could be what I
    need, but the last update says that it isn&amp;#8217;t finished yet, and that
    was in &lt;strong&gt;2005&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mandriva Linux has pretty extensive information on their build
    system &lt;a href="http://wiki.mandriva.com/en/Category:Build_System"&gt;on their
    wiki&lt;/a&gt; and a
    &lt;a href="http://wiki.mandriva.com/en/Development/Packaging/BuildSystem/Theory"&gt;build system theory
    page&lt;/a&gt;,
    but it seems to be largely a hodgepodge of shell scripts and
    cronjobs, and is likely not a candidate for use by anyone other than
    its&amp;nbsp;designers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Argeo provides the &lt;a href="https://www.argeo.org/wiki/SLC"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SLC&lt;/span&gt; framework&lt;/a&gt;
    which has a &amp;#8220;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;RPM&lt;/span&gt; Factory&amp;#8221; component, but I can&amp;#8217;t seem to find much
    more than a wiki page, and can&amp;#8217;t tell if it&amp;#8217;s a build automation
    system or just handles mocking packages and putting them in a repo
    on a single&amp;nbsp;host.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dag Wieers&amp;#8217; repositories use (or used) a set of python scripts
    called &lt;a href="http://dag.wieers.com/home-made/dar/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DAR&lt;/span&gt;, &amp;#8220;Dynamic Apt Repository
    builder&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt;. They&amp;#8217;re on
    &lt;a href="https://github.com/dagwieers/dar"&gt;github&lt;/a&gt; but are listed as &amp;#8220;old&amp;#8221;
    and haven&amp;#8217;t been updated in at least 2 years. The features sound
    quite interesting, and though it&amp;#8217;s based on the Apt repo format, it
    might provide some good ideas for implementing a similar&amp;nbsp;system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update four months later:&lt;/strong&gt; I&amp;#8217;ve yet to find a build system that meets
my requirements above. For the moment I&amp;#8217;m only managing \~20 packages,
so my &amp;#8220;build system&amp;#8221; is a single shell script that reads in some
environment variables and runs through using
&lt;a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Projects/Mock"&gt;mock&lt;/a&gt; to build them in the
correct order (including pushing the finished RPMs back into the local
repository that mock reads from) and then pushing the finished packages
to our internal repository. Maybe when I have some spare time, I&amp;#8217;ll
consider a project to either make a slightly better (but simple) &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RPM&lt;/span&gt;
build system based on Python, or get our
&lt;a href="http://jenkins-ci.org/"&gt;Jenkins&lt;/a&gt; install to handle this for&amp;nbsp;me.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">admin</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 13 May 2013 05:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:newblog.jasonantman.com,2013-05-13:2013/05/search-for-a-small-scale-but-automated-rpm-build-system/</guid><category>build</category><category>linux</category><category>nodejs</category><category>package</category><category>packaging</category><category>repository</category><category>rpm</category><category>rpmbuild</category><category>software</category><category>sysadmin</category><category>yum</category></item><item><title>Creating RPMs from Perl CPANÂ Modules</title><link>http://newblog.jasonantman.com/2012/05/creating-rpms-from-perl-cpan-modules/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I try my absolute best to always install software on my Linux boxes as
&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RPM_Package_Manager"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;RPM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;s, installed
through &lt;a href="http://yum.baseurl.org/"&gt;Yum&lt;/a&gt; (yes, I use
&lt;a href="http://www.centos.org"&gt;CentOS&lt;/a&gt; on servers and
&lt;a href="http://fedoraproject.org/"&gt;Fedora&lt;/a&gt; on my desktops/laptops). Not only is
this more-or-less required to sanely manage configuration through
Puppet, but it also lets me recreate a machine, or install dependencies
for something, in one simple command line. Unfortunately, I run quite a
bit of Perl code, and there are a lot of &lt;a href="http://www.cpan.org/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CPAN&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
Perl modules that aren&amp;#8217;t in any of the usual CentOS/Fedora&amp;nbsp;repositories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enter cpan2rpm: a Perl script that, in its simplest invocation,
downloads a specified &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CPAN&lt;/span&gt; module and automatically builds RPMs and
SRPMs for it. The &lt;a href="http://perl.arix.com/cpan2rpm/"&gt;original version&lt;/a&gt; by
&lt;a href="http://www.arix.com/ec/"&gt;Erick Calder&lt;/a&gt; hasn&amp;#8217;t been touched since 2005,
but there&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href="http://www.mediaburst.co.uk/blog/creating-perl-module-rpms/"&gt;a newer version from
Mediaburst&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href="http://www2.mbstatic.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/cpan2rpmmb"&gt;cpan2rpmmb&lt;/a&gt;,
that seems to incorporate some nice improvements and worked quite well
for&amp;nbsp;me.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">admin</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 15 May 2012 15:01:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:newblog.jasonantman.com,2012-05-15:2012/05/creating-rpms-from-perl-cpan-modules/</guid><category>cpan</category><category>cpan2rpm</category><category>perl</category><category>rpm</category><category>yum</category></item></channel></rss>
