released numerous (I think the product like is now up to about 10
variations) follow-ups to the 7&amp;#8221; beauty, now up to 10&amp;#8221; in size (though,
admittedly, I&amp;#8217;m less-than-enthused about their Windows&amp;nbsp;models).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the new semester here, I am (unfortunately) back in class. And I&amp;#8217;m
very happy to report that I&amp;#8217;m starting to see eeePCs in more and more
hands. Granted, my classes are in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IT&lt;/span&gt; program, but I was quite
surprised last night to be sitting in my Internet Security class and
notice no less than four eeePCs in a class of about 25 people. While
I&amp;#8217;ve just relegated my own 4G to my server room bag, replacing it with a
(used, surplus from work) &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IBM&lt;/span&gt; ThinkPad T41 (14.1&amp;#8221; display, 1.4GHz
Pentium, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;768MB&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RAM&lt;/span&gt;, and a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DVD&lt;/span&gt; drive). Though my heart sank when I found
that half of the eeePCs were running Windows, it seems that in my
travels around campus, I&amp;#8217;m seeing more and more eeePCs, and more laptops
running&amp;nbsp;Linux.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the academic world has surely embraced new technologies, and
non-mainstream technologies, quicker than other sectors (specifically
considering Linux and the apparent popularity of the eeePC), it&amp;#8217;s
definitely a good omen. Seeing non-geek, and perhaps even non-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CS&lt;/span&gt; and
non-Engineering, students using Linux speaks quite well for the
expansion of the Linux user base when these students graduate and enter
the &amp;#8220;real&amp;nbsp;world&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="asus"></category><category term="eeepc"></category><category term="linux"></category></entry></feed>
