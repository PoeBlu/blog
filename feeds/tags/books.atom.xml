Management for System Administrators&lt;/a&gt; were
infinitely helpful in the early days of my professional life, and are
among the few (literally, 4 or 5) books that live on my desk. His
insight and information into the soft skills of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SA&lt;/span&gt; work - time
management, hiring, working in teams, etc. - is not only excellent, but
also all too rare in a largely technical&amp;nbsp;field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, Tom posted the below article to his blog about a book that
recently came out, &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0195374126/tomontime-20"&gt;&amp;#8220;Taming Information Technology: Lessons from Studies
of System Administrators&amp;#8221; by Eser Kandogan, Paul Maglio, Eben Haber and
John Bailey&lt;/a&gt;. I
haven&amp;#8217;t read the book yet, and at $56, it&amp;#8217;s going to be a while before
my book budget recovers enough to justify it. But going on what I&amp;#8217;ve
read from Tom and others, I want it. Not only do I want to read it, but
I want to pass it around to my parents and in-laws and everyone else who
has asked what I do for a living, and I found myself at a loss for a
less-than-6-hour-long explanation. So, here&amp;#8217;s what Tom wrote on&amp;nbsp;it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Mom And&amp;nbsp;Dad,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many times I&amp;#8217;ve tried to explain to you what I do for a living.
&amp;#8220;Computer system administrator&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;sysadmin&amp;#8221; is a career that is
difficult to explain and I&amp;#8217;m sure my attempts have left you even more
confused. I have good news. Oxford University Press has just published
a book by 4 scientists who video taped sysadmins doing their job,
analysed what they do, and explains it to the non-computer person.
They do it by telling compelling stories of sysadmins at work plus
they give interesting analysis with great&amp;nbsp;insight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why did they do this? Because businesses depend on technology more and
more and that means they depend on sysadmins more and more. Yet most
CEOs don&amp;#8217;t understand what we do. The scientists made some interesting
discoveries: that our jobs are high-stress, high-risk, and highly
collaborative. We invent our own tools, often on the spot, to solve
complex problems. We are men and women of every age group. It is a
career unlike any other. These are things that most people don&amp;#8217;t know
about our profession. The book is very engaging: Some of the chapters
read like the opening scene of &amp;#8220;Indiana Jones&amp;#8221;; others like &amp;#8220;Gorillas
in the Mist.&amp;#8221; Kandogan, Maglio, Haber and Bailey have put together a
very serious, scientific book with care and&amp;nbsp;compassion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m not one of the sysadmins they studied but every story they tell
reminds me of real experiences I have&amp;nbsp;had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope you enjoy reading this book. I know I&amp;nbsp;did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pre-order it here:
&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0195374126/tomontime-20"&gt;http://www.amazon.com/dp/0195374126/tomontime-20&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sincerely your son,&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;Tom&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;P.S.&lt;/span&gt; In all seriousness, I read a preview copy of this book and highly
recommend it to others. You may have seen the authors speak at Usenix
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;LISA&lt;/span&gt; or &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LOPSA&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PICC&lt;/span&gt; conferences where they showed clips of the video
tapes they made. The book conveys the same stories, plus many more,
with interesting analysis. If you think that the profession of system
administration would benefit from non-sysadmins better understanding
what we do, I highly recommend you pre-order this book and share it.

Eben Haber and John&amp;nbsp;Bailey&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have any interest, I encourage you to go out and buy the book. If
you know someone who&amp;#8217;s an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SA&lt;/span&gt;, you should buy them the book. If you can
justify any sort of book budget at work, you should buy the book. And
while you&amp;#8217;re at it, if you haven&amp;#8217;t read Tom&amp;#8217;s other books, you should
buy those too. You might be in the unfortunate position - like I am - of
probably never being able to implement most of his suggestions at work,
but at least you&amp;#8217;ll be aware of&amp;nbsp;them&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="books"></category><category term="limoncelli"></category><category term="sysadmin"></category></entry><entry><title>Practical PHP and MySQL</title><link href="https://blog.jasonantman.com/2008/06/practical-php-and-mysql/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2008-06-26T14:29:00-04:00</published><updated>2008-06-26T14:29:00-04:00</updated><author><name>admin</name></author><id>tag:blog.jasonantman.com,2008-06-26:/2008/06/practical-php-and-mysql/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m taking a summer course in Building Data Driven Websites - not that I

thought I&amp;#8217;d learn much in such a course at
&lt;a href="http://scils.rutgers.edu"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SCILS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but I&amp;#8217;d like to graduate on time, and
need the credits, and Bill Crosbie is just the type of rare teacher that
can keep even me awake and interested. Our book is &lt;a href="http://www.informit.com/store/product.aspx?isbn=0132239973"&gt;Practical &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt; and
MySQL: Building Eight Dynamic Web
Applications&lt;/a&gt;
(&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Practical-PHP-MySQL-Building-Applications/dp/0132239973"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;)
by &lt;a href="http://www.jonobacon.org/"&gt;Jono Bacon&lt;/a&gt;. Now, I know it&amp;#8217;s not a
&lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; book like, say, &lt;a href="http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596003432/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ESA3&lt;/span&gt; by
Frisch&lt;/a&gt;, which has a healthy
&lt;a href="http://www.aeleen.com/home.htm"&gt;web presense&lt;/a&gt;. But this thing is all
code and doesn&amp;#8217;t even have a web site, let alone easy code&amp;nbsp;downloads!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book does come with a heavily customized Ubuntu LiveCD. However,
when I popped it in my &lt;a href="http://www.opensuse.org"&gt;OpenSuSE workstation&lt;/a&gt;,
I couldn&amp;#8217;t really make much out of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CD&lt;/span&gt; - there was certainly no
easy-to-find &amp;#8220;this is the code&amp;#8221; directory. Well, after some exploring, I
mounted the &lt;a href="http://squashfs.sourceforge.net/"&gt;SquashFS&lt;/a&gt; filesystem and
poked around a bit. Strange&amp;#8230; seems to only have one real user (root)
and, though they claim this is a fully-functional &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LAMP&lt;/span&gt; server, no Apache
or MySQL. Really weird. Well, after poking for a few minutes, I found
the holy grail - &lt;code&gt;/root/.bash_history&lt;/code&gt; was intact! Just a quick look
through it with &lt;code&gt;less&lt;/code&gt; and I found what I was looking for: &lt;code&gt;/opt/lampp&lt;/code&gt;.
It appears that the install is actually ApacheFriends&amp;#8217;
&lt;a href="http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp-linux.html"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;LAMPP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;span class="caps"&gt;XAMPP&lt;/span&gt; for
Linux (gotta wonder if the guy writing this book doesn&amp;#8217;t even know how
to install Apache&amp;#8230; I&amp;#8217;m sure &lt;span class="caps"&gt;XAMPP&lt;/span&gt; for Linux is more bloated than a
customized build of Apache/MySQL/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt; from source, especially since it&amp;#8217;s
only being used to host 8 sample projects, so a lot could be left&amp;nbsp;out).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, it appears that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LAMPP&lt;/span&gt; is running in a chroot&amp;#8217;ed environment. The
actual sample code is rooted at &lt;code&gt;/opt/lampp/htdocs/sites&lt;/code&gt;. It seems that
&lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt; files are also owned by root and chmod&amp;#8217;ed 777! And
the top-level &lt;code&gt;index.php&lt;/code&gt; file makes use of absolute links, so obviously
he never thought that someone may want to copy the sample code and use
it on a &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just can&amp;#8217;t imagine someone who&amp;#8217;s a beginner with Linux, let alone a
Windows person, trying to get this source code onto a machine where they
can actually play with it. And&amp;#8230; to make the situation worse&amp;#8230; the
LiveCD has vi and vim, but no Emacs!!!!&amp;nbsp;Eeeek!!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="books"></category><category term="linux"></category><category term="PHP"></category><category term="programming"></category><category term="rutgers"></category></entry></feed>
