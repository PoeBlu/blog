for quite a while; his books &lt;a href="http://everythingsysadmin.com/aboutbook.html"&gt;The Practice of System and Network

Management for System Administrators&lt;/a&gt; were
infinitely helpful in the early days of my professional life, and are
among the few (literally, 4 or 5) books that live on my desk. His
insight and information into the soft skills of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SA&lt;/span&gt; work - time
management, hiring, working in teams, etc. - is not only excellent, but
also all too rare in a largely technical&amp;nbsp;field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, Tom posted the below article to his blog about a book that
recently came out, &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0195374126/tomontime-20"&gt;&amp;#8220;Taming Information Technology: Lessons from Studies
of System Administrators&amp;#8221; by Eser Kandogan, Paul Maglio, Eben Haber and
John Bailey&lt;/a&gt;. I
haven&amp;#8217;t read the book yet, and at $56, it&amp;#8217;s going to be a while before
my book budget recovers enough to justify it. But going on what I&amp;#8217;ve
read from Tom and others, I want it. Not only do I want to read it, but
I want to pass it around to my parents and in-laws and everyone else who
has asked what I do for a living, and I found myself at a loss for a
less-than-6-hour-long explanation. So, here&amp;#8217;s what Tom wrote on&amp;nbsp;it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Mom And&amp;nbsp;Dad,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many times I&amp;#8217;ve tried to explain to you what I do for a living.
&amp;#8220;Computer system administrator&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;sysadmin&amp;#8221; is a career that is
difficult to explain and I&amp;#8217;m sure my attempts have left you even more
confused. I have good news. Oxford University Press has just published
a book by 4 scientists who video taped sysadmins doing their job,
analysed what they do, and explains it to the non-computer person.
They do it by telling compelling stories of sysadmins at work plus
they give interesting analysis with great&amp;nbsp;insight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why did they do this? Because businesses depend on technology more and
more and that means they depend on sysadmins more and more. Yet most
CEOs don&amp;#8217;t understand what we do. The scientists made some interesting
discoveries: that our jobs are high-stress, high-risk, and highly
collaborative. We invent our own tools, often on the spot, to solve
complex problems. We are men and women of every age group. It is a
career unlike any other. These are things that most people don&amp;#8217;t know
about our profession. The book is very engaging: Some of the chapters
read like the opening scene of &amp;#8220;Indiana Jones&amp;#8221;; others like &amp;#8220;Gorillas
in the Mist.&amp;#8221; Kandogan, Maglio, Haber and Bailey have put together a
very serious, scientific book with care and&amp;nbsp;compassion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m not one of the sysadmins they studied but every story they tell
reminds me of real experiences I have&amp;nbsp;had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope you enjoy reading this book. I know I&amp;nbsp;did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pre-order it here:
&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0195374126/tomontime-20"&gt;http://www.amazon.com/dp/0195374126/tomontime-20&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sincerely your son,&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;Tom&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;P.S.&lt;/span&gt; In all seriousness, I read a preview copy of this book and highly
recommend it to others. You may have seen the authors speak at Usenix
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;LISA&lt;/span&gt; or &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LOPSA&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PICC&lt;/span&gt; conferences where they showed clips of the video
tapes they made. The book conveys the same stories, plus many more,
with interesting analysis. If you think that the profession of system
administration would benefit from non-sysadmins better understanding
what we do, I highly recommend you pre-order this book and share it.
You can pre-order it here: &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0195374126/tomontime-20"&gt;&amp;#8220;Taming Information Technology: Lessons

Eben Haber and John&amp;nbsp;Bailey&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have any interest, I encourage you to go out and buy the book. If
you know someone who&amp;#8217;s an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SA&lt;/span&gt;, you should buy them the book. If you can
justify any sort of book budget at work, you should buy the book. And
while you&amp;#8217;re at it, if you haven&amp;#8217;t read Tom&amp;#8217;s other books, you should
buy those too. You might be in the unfortunate position - like I am - of
probably never being able to implement most of his suggestions at work,
but at least you&amp;#8217;ll be aware of&amp;nbsp;them&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="books"></category><category term="limoncelli"></category><category term="sysadmin"></category></entry><entry><title>A Collection of Great Links on Monitoring, SysAdmin, Scaling, etc.</title><link href="http://blog.jasonantman.com/2012/04/a-collection-of-great-links-on-monitoring-sysadmin-scaling-etc/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2012-04-21T10:24:00-04:00</published><updated>2012-04-21T10:24:00-04:00</updated><author><name>admin</name></author><id>tag:blog.jasonantman.com,2012-04-21:/2012/04/a-collection-of-great-links-on-monitoring-sysadmin-scaling-etc/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve had a bunch of tabs open in my browser for a while - stuff that I

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://blog.mongodb.org/post/172254834/mongodb-is-fantastic-for-logging"&gt;MongoDB is Fantastic for
    Logging&lt;/a&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I was looking into some log storage ideas, and came by this post
(on the MongoDB blog) about why Mongo is well-suited to storing&amp;nbsp;logs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sonian.com/cloud-monitoring-sensu/"&gt;Sensu&lt;/a&gt; - a
    Ruby-based cloud-oriented monitoring system. It uses &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AMQP&lt;/span&gt;/RabbitMQ
    to communicate between the clients and server, which is a really big
    part of what I think monitoring should&amp;nbsp;be.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://highscalability.com/"&gt;High Scalability&lt;/a&gt; - this is one of the
    few blogs I follow on a regular basis. Some really wonderful stuff,
    and great food for&amp;nbsp;thought.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://everythingsysadmin.com/2012/03/fear-of-rebooting.html"&gt;Everything Sysadmin: Fear of
    Rebooting&lt;/a&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A great article on Tom Limoncelli&amp;#8217;s blog about why we fear
rebooting machines and why this is bad - moreover, why we should
reboot&amp;nbsp;often.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

    Distributed
    System&lt;/a&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is a &lt;em&gt;really, really&lt;/em&gt; cool post NetFlix about how latency
increases in a single subsystem can bring down their whole &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; in
seconds, and how they combat this. Really cool&amp;nbsp;stuff.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://arstechnica.com/business/news/2012/04/exclusive-a-behind-the-scenes-look-at-facebook-release-engineering.ars/1"&gt;Ars Technica - Exclusive: a behind-the-scenes look at Facebook
    release
    engineering&lt;/a&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ars Technical is more or less &amp;#8220;mainstream media&amp;#8221; to me, but this
is a really interesting writeup on Facebook&amp;#8217;s release engineering
process, albeit at a higher level. Specifically, it talks about
their automation, phased rollouts, rollbacks, and how they release
the Facebook codebase as a single giant binary, sent out via&amp;nbsp;BitTorrent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/monitoringsucks/blog-posts"&gt;Monitoring Sucks blog posts
    (github)&lt;/a&gt; - The
    &amp;#8220;monitoing sucks&amp;#8221; movement really speaks to me, having worked
    extensively with Nagios, Cacti, and similar technologies.
    Specifically, having rolled out monitoring in a variety of &amp;#8220;weird&amp;#8221;
    scenarios (a lot of monitoring devices or whole networks behind &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NAT&lt;/span&gt;,
    on dynamic &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IP&lt;/span&gt; connections, or otherwise unreachable from a central
    server), I&amp;#8217;ve felt a lot of pain in the current want of doing
    things. There are a lot of &lt;strong&gt;really&lt;/strong&gt; good thoughts linked here,
    especially the &lt;a href="http://jedi.be/blog/2012/01/03/monitoring-wonderland-survey-introduction"&gt;&amp;#8220;wonderland&amp;#8221; series by Patrick
    Debois&lt;/a&gt;
    and the &lt;a href="http://holmwood.id.au/~lindsay/2012/01/09/monitoring-sucks-latency-sucks-more"&gt;&amp;#8220;Latency sucks&amp;#8221; series by Lindsay
    Holmwood&lt;/a&gt;.
    This really got me thinking about my ideal monitoring system, which
    among other things, would integrate the &amp;#8220;alerting&amp;#8221; functions of
    Nagios with graphing/trending and correlation, would be based on
    some sort of message queue architecture (that supports multiple
    levels of proxies that could gracefully support &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NAT&lt;/span&gt; and multiple
    hops), and would be configured almost totally on the originating
    &amp;#8220;client&amp;#8221; (unlike the pain of distributed&amp;nbsp;Nagios/Icinga).&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PDF&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;presentation slides. I&amp;#8217;d &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; to see the video. Some really good
ideas about putting the science back into being a SysAdmin. Also
mentions a few tools I really want to play around with (including
ganglia, graphite, logster and StatsD). Also mentions adding &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt;
memory usage and time to Apache logs, which I don&amp;#8217;t believe I never
thought&amp;nbsp;of.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some really thoughtful posts from &lt;span class="caps"&gt;R. I.&lt;/span&gt; Pienaar on &lt;a href="http://www.devco.net/archives/2011/03/19/thinking_about_monitoring_frameworks.php"&gt;Thinking about
    monitoring
    frameworks&lt;/a&gt;
    and &lt;a href="http://www.devco.net/archives/2011/04/04/monitoring_framework_composable_architectures.php"&gt;Composable
    Architectures&lt;/a&gt;.
    Some really good stuff, but what else would you expect from someone
    &lt;a href="https://github.com/ripienaar/"&gt;like this&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
