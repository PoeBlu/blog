class). I have a big paper to write for one of them, due at the worst
time possible - July 5th. The day after what is, probably, one of the
busiest days of the year for the &lt;a href="http://www.midlandparkambulance.com"&gt;ambulance
corps&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In follow-ups and&amp;nbsp;news:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://tuxostat.jasonantman.com"&gt;tuxostat&lt;/a&gt; has been running for
    nearly a month in my apartment, and appears stable, albeit missing
    many planned features, and with a sub-optimal interface (and no &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SNMP&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;yet).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.tuxtruck.org"&gt;TuxTruck&lt;/a&gt; is still on the back&amp;nbsp;burner.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve been playing around with the idea of writing a new electronic
    patient care report system for the ambulance corps, to replace our
    current three-year-old system (written in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VB&lt;/span&gt; .&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NET&lt;/span&gt; and running on
    Windows). It would probably be coded in Python, with a
    wxWindows/&lt;a href="http://www.wxpython.org/"&gt;wxPython&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GUI&lt;/span&gt;. I&amp;#8217;ll start on a
    small demo version, but would like it to be fully modular, and
    eventually form a codebase for &lt;a href="http://www.openepcr.org"&gt;OpenEPCR&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I&amp;#8217;ve been doing a lot of work for my Building Data-Driven
Websites class (well, alternate assignments, but still a lot of work).
The latest project was an Ajax/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DHTML&lt;/span&gt; calendar. Needless to say, this involved a lot of JavaScript work. To
make it worse, I used a fair amount of sample code to get an idea of how
to do things, and way too many of the snippets out there on the &amp;#8216;net are
in formats that are quite unfriendly for pasting into an Emacs console&amp;nbsp;window.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I happened to come by &lt;a href="http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/"&gt;Steve Yegge&amp;#8217;s
blog&lt;/a&gt;, with a posting on &lt;a href="http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2008/03/js2-mode-new-javascript-mode-for-emacs.html"&gt;his
JavaScript mode for
Emacs&lt;/a&gt;.
Not only does it seem cool, but it was also the only one I could find
that does syntax highlighting and sane indentation (important for copied
code snippets). So, I grabbed it from &lt;a href="http://code.google.com/p/js2-mode/"&gt;Google
Code&lt;/a&gt; and -&amp;nbsp;viola!&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="ajax"></category><category term="call report"></category><category term="dhtml"></category><category term="javascript"></category><category term="pcr"></category><category term="tuxostat"></category><category term="tuxtruck"></category></entry><entry><title>OpenOffice Calc formula for IP addresses</title><link href="http://newblog.jasonantman.com/2008/05/openoffice-calc-formula-for-ip-addresses/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2008-05-30T10:56:00-04:00</updated><author><name>admin</name></author><id>tag:newblog.jasonantman.com,2008-05-30:2008/05/openoffice-calc-formula-for-ip-addresses/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s been a while since I&amp;#8217;ve posted. Things are quite busy, with work 4
days a week (9-5) and classes 6-9:30 at night 4 days a week (though
classes are Mon-Thurs and work is&amp;nbsp;Tues-Fri).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m plodding along on with &lt;a href="http://www.tuxtruck.org/"&gt;TuxTruc&lt;/a&gt;k - we now
have a domain name
(&lt;a href="http://www.tuxtruck.org/"&gt;http://www.tuxtruck.org/&lt;/a&gt;) and playlist
generation is finished. This weekend should yield playlist parsing. Once
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;MP3&lt;/span&gt; playing is working, I&amp;#8217;ll begin the hardcore development - &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPS&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OBD&lt;/span&gt;,
and Bluetooth. Also, I&amp;#8217;m working on a hardware budget for the prototype,
but it&amp;#8217;s ending up much higher than originally imagined. If I end up
going with the &lt;a href="http://www.xenarc.com/product/MDT-X7000.html"&gt;Xenarc
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;MDT&lt;/span&gt;-X7000&lt;/a&gt; display (which
includes a head unit with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DVD&lt;/span&gt; playing, amplifier, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CD&lt;/span&gt; playing, and radio
- though those are features I&amp;#8217;d rather to in software on the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PC&lt;/span&gt;, and
just use the amplifier) which runs $800 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USD&lt;/span&gt;, the total is looking more
like $2000 than the $1000 I had planned. More to the point, the X7000
currently has poor reviews, and is backordered everywhere pending a
firmware revision. I may end up going the route of a separate head unit,
or a dedicated amplifier (though volume control is still an issue) and
getting a better daylight-readable touchscreen (though I still have a
strong preference for a motorized in-dash type, given the theft rate
around&amp;nbsp;school).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another item of news - my mother is considering moving from Verizon FiOS
to the Cablevision/Optimum Triple Play - iO digital &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TV&lt;/span&gt;, cable, and
voice. Given that jasonantman.com - and all of my other machines - live
on shelves in her basement, this will have quite an impact on me. And a
good one! Optimum offers Business-grade service at 30 Mbps down/5 Mbps
up &lt;strong&gt;with 5 static IPs&lt;/strong&gt; at a rate
that I can afford. So, there may be an end to DynDNS, and my sites might
finally live on port 80, like they should! On the down side, this would
mean (for digital &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TV&lt;/span&gt;) a major coax rewiring of mom&amp;#8217;s house - and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RG&lt;/span&gt;-6/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;UQ&lt;/span&gt;
isn&amp;#8217;t&amp;nbsp;cheap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the tip of the day - OpenOffice Calc formula to increase the
last quad of an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IP&lt;/span&gt; address by&amp;nbsp;one:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;=CONCATENATE(LEFT(A1;SEARCH(".[0-9]+$";A1));VALUE(RIGHT(A1;LEN(A1)-SEARCH(".[0-9]+$";A1)))+1)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was doing up a little spreadsheet of IPs in the office, and like a
good &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SA&lt;/span&gt; (with nothing else to do), came up with a formula to increase
the last octet by one. Just enter a dotted-quad &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IP&lt;/span&gt; in A1 (or whatever
other cell, correcting the formula), paste this below it, and copy down
the page to your heart&amp;#8217;s content. (Granted, it only changes the last
octet, and expects a properly formatted&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;IP&lt;/span&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="ip address"></category><category term="openoffice"></category><category term="spreadsheet"></category><category term="tuxtruck"></category></entry><entry><title>SunSPOT; CarPC; MediaWiki Logging</title><link href="http://newblog.jasonantman.com/2008/05/sunspot-carpc-mediawiki-logging/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2008-05-07T10:03:00-04:00</updated><author><name>admin</name></author><id>tag:newblog.jasonantman.com,2008-05-07:2008/05/sunspot-carpc-mediawiki-logging/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Well, finals season is upon me. That&amp;#8217;s probably why I haven&amp;#8217;t been
posting much lately (I haven&amp;#8217;t even been checking &lt;a href="http://reader.google.com/"&gt;Google
Reader&lt;/a&gt; - I&amp;#8217;ll have to delete a few thousand
entries when I get back into the swing of things). I&amp;#8217;ve been pretty
busy, between studying, projects, and work. I&amp;#8217;ll be working 4 days a
week through June 20th, as well as taking night classes 4 nigths a week
(unfortunately not the same 4 days) through July 3, in an effort to
graduate Rutgers on time (after transferring in and also switching
majors). Work after June 20th is up in the air - who knows how hard the
budget cuts will&amp;nbsp;hit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My internship as the Sun Microsystems Campus Ambassador to Rutgers is
over on May 12th. I got a chance to do the Rutgers &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IT&lt;/span&gt; Vendor Fair with
Sun, and met a few cool people - especially including Matt McGrath of
&lt;a href="http://www.conres.com/"&gt;Continental Resources&lt;/a&gt;, a Sun Strategic iForce
Partner, who&amp;#8217;s doing some wonderful things with the &lt;a href="http://www.sun.com/solutions/landing/industry/education/edu_essentials.jsp"&gt;Sun Education
Essentials Matching Grant
Program&lt;/a&gt;,
and &lt;a href="http://opsamericas.com/"&gt;Skip Paul&lt;/a&gt;, a Linux Systems Engineer for
Novell&amp;#8217;s Open Platform Solutions group. I also finally cracked open my
demo set of &lt;a href="http://www.sunspotworld.com/"&gt;SunSPOT&lt;/a&gt;s. Wonderful little
devices, radio, run Java on the bare metal, and have temperature
sensors, accelerometers, and liberal I/O. My first development exereice
will probably be making a temperature and acceleration data logger for
my truck, but there&amp;#8217;s surely more to come. They&amp;#8217;re&amp;nbsp;great!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My newest project - which I&amp;#8217;m hoping to spend nearly the whole summer on
- is the &lt;a href="http://www.jasonantman.com/tuxtruck/"&gt;TuxTruck&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;#8217;ve been
frustrated with the lack of &amp;#8220;smartness&amp;#8221; in my truck (an 06 Ford F-250),
not to mention having to remember my &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MP3&lt;/span&gt; player so I can listen to
podcasts on the way to work, and having so many gadgets in my truck. So,
the solution is obvious: a Linux-based
&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpc"&gt;CarPC&lt;/a&gt;. A nice little Mini-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ATX&lt;/span&gt; box
under a seat, with a 7&amp;#8221; pull-out touchscreen in the dash (replacing the
factory radio). It&amp;#8217;s a big, complicated, and expensive project - but I
want one, and I could use some experience with smaller systems.&lt;br /&gt;
The major features I have&amp;nbsp;planned:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Realtime &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPS&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;navigation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hands-free bluetooth calls from my cell, with address book, routing
    to contact address, possibly voice&amp;nbsp;dialing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Realtime&amp;nbsp;weather&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;OBD&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;II&lt;/span&gt; interface, for vehicle diagnostics and fuel
    efficiency/performance&amp;nbsp;profiling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Audio - at a minimum searching and playing MP3s, and automatically
    downloading podcasts and throwing them in a playlist. Perhaps also
    an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AM&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;FM&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;tuner&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s not an easy project. So far, the major challenges seem to&amp;nbsp;be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No full-featured &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPS&lt;/span&gt; navigation package available. The ones that are
    available don&amp;#8217;t seem to be too easy to integrate into my planned
    &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GUI&lt;/span&gt;, which will allot them 800x420 pixels (on an 800x480 screen) and
    requre the bottom toolbar to be always&amp;nbsp;available.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to handle processing of multiple data streams that require
    near-real-time processing - specifically, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPS&lt;/span&gt; with text-to-speech,
    turn-by-turn directions, plus playing audio, plus responding to an
    incoming phone call in a timely manner, pausing the audio, and
    stopping &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPS&lt;/span&gt; audio but continuing&amp;nbsp;navigation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whether to install a smaller stereo and use aux input for audio, or
    totally rip out the stereo, use an amp with the computer as its only
    input, and then how to control&amp;nbsp;volume?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be more to come in the future. For now, take a look at &lt;a href="https://github.com/jantman/tuxtruck"&gt;the
TuxTruck github&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update Saturday, March 2, 2013&lt;/strong&gt; - I&amp;#8217;m in the process of migrating my
legacy &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CVS&lt;/span&gt; and Subversion repositories to
&lt;a href="http://github.com/jantman/"&gt;github.com&lt;/a&gt;. The forgotten &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SVN&lt;/span&gt; repository
for TuxTruck has been migrated there, and the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CVS&lt;/span&gt; repository will soon
be moved there as well. Tuxtruck.org has been permanently taken offline
and redirected to the GitHub&amp;nbsp;repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mediawiki Logging&lt;/strong&gt; - I recently
had a situation where I had to confirm how much work someone had done on
a MediaWiki-based project. The Recent Changes page only goes back 30
days, and walking through the History of each page is a pain. After
looking around in the database a bit, I found a few tables of&amp;nbsp;interest:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Table &amp;#8220;users&amp;#8221; includes fields &amp;#8220;user_touched&amp;#8221; (last time the user
    was updated) and &amp;#8220;user_editcount&amp;#8221; (a really simple count of the
    users&amp;#8217; number of&amp;nbsp;edits).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Table &amp;#8220;recentchanges&amp;#8221; holds a lot of data&amp;#8230; seemingly the entire
    life of the&amp;nbsp;wiki&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
