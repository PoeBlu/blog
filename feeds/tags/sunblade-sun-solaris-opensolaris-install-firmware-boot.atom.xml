The price
seemed right, and I figure that at the very least, they&amp;#8217;d give me some
Sparc machines to play around with. The two seem slightly different.
Externally, one has a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CD&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;RW&lt;/span&gt; and one has a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DVD&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ROM&lt;/span&gt;. The one with the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DVD&lt;/span&gt;,
the first one I&amp;#8217;m working with, has a 650MHz Sparc IIi, 512 Mb &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RAM&lt;/span&gt;, and
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;XXXXX&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HDD&lt;/span&gt;. I&amp;#8217;ll figure out the specs on the second when I get it&amp;nbsp;running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also both use simple &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EIDE&lt;/span&gt; drives, so I might put a new drive in,
after checking drive current drive information through &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SMART&lt;/span&gt;. I planned
on using one of the machines (probably this first one, the 650MHz with
the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DVD&lt;/span&gt;) to replace my aging mailserver at home (a 350MHz Pentium &lt;span class="caps"&gt;II&lt;/span&gt;
Gateway desktop), running Solaris 10. The other one will be a
workstation/desktop for me, which will probably run either Solaris 10 or
Solaris Express Developer Edition&amp;nbsp;(&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SXDE&lt;/span&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the project seems to have hit a dead-end. Both systems
have hardware/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NVRAM&lt;/span&gt; security setup, so they won&amp;#8217;t boot from &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CD&lt;/span&gt; without a
password. They also won&amp;#8217;t boot the existing Solaris installation, as
it&amp;#8217;s looking for a whole bunch of network services that don&amp;#8217;t exist. I
found a few suggestions online on how to bypass this, but none of them
worked. So, at this point, I have a few options to&amp;nbsp;consider:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hope that as a Sun Microsystems Campus Ambassador, I can contact
    someone who can advise me on how to clear out the password or&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NVRAM&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hope that as a Rutgers employee, I can track down someone on the
    Camden campus where these came from that may have the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NVRAM&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;password.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Break down and pay $40 each for *new* &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NVRAM&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;chips.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;ll see what the next few days brings. Hopefully not resorting to a
solution that costs more than I paid for the&amp;nbsp;machines.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="sunblade sun solaris opensolaris install firmware boot"></category></entry></feed>
