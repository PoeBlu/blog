&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NG&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on our Linux boxes to keep track of
hardware. Part of the plan is also that we have a
&lt;a href="http://www.mediawiki.org"&gt;MediaWiki&lt;/a&gt; installation for internal
documentation, and articles for every host (named as the hostname). I&amp;#8217;m
going to pull data from &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OCS&lt;/span&gt; into the articles based on hostname (via a
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt; include) so the documentation will automatically include up-to-date
information on&amp;nbsp;hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since we&amp;#8217;re moving to MySQL-backed &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DHCP&lt;/span&gt;, I decided that it would also be
nice to include &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DHCP&lt;/span&gt; information and links to our web tool to edit the
host (like setting &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PXE&lt;/span&gt; boot information). This is pretty easy for the
ethX interfaces, as &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OCS&lt;/span&gt; collects &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MAC&lt;/span&gt; addresses and I can search our &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DHCP&lt;/span&gt;
database for them. However, it isn&amp;#8217;t as simple for the iLOM interface,
which (obviously) &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OCS&lt;/span&gt; knows nothing about - though it&amp;#8217;s arguably one of
the most-forgotten things on our&amp;nbsp;machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HP&lt;/span&gt; Proliant servers have the nice little &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HP&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PSP&lt;/span&gt; (Proliant
Support Pack) that includes tools such as &lt;code&gt;hpasmcli&lt;/code&gt;, but Sun doesn&amp;#8217;t
have anything like that. (We just have one &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HP&lt;/span&gt; box in production right
now, but I&amp;#8217;ll probably be adding support for it&amp;nbsp;soon).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enter &lt;a href="http://openipmi.sourceforge.net/"&gt;OpenIPMI&lt;/a&gt;. The iLOM has an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IPMI&lt;/span&gt;
interface, and the standard OpenIPMI-tools package in CentOS
repositories has the ipmitool required to get the relevant information.
A call is pretty simple: &lt;code&gt;ipmitool -l open lan print 1&lt;/code&gt; yields something&amp;nbsp;like:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Set in Progress         : Set Complete
Auth Type Support       : &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NONE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MD2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MD5&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PASSWORD&lt;/span&gt;
Auth Type Enable        : Callback : &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MD2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MD5&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PASSWORD&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Now it&amp;#8217;s just a matter of integrating this into ocsinventory-agent,
having it run the command if present (and Sun hardware), and parsing the
results. Once I have some actual code done, I&amp;#8217;ll pass it&amp;nbsp;along.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For now, I&amp;#8217;m installing two beautiful SunFire x4150&amp;#8217;s at work, and
here&amp;#8217;s a little bit of information on how to use these great&amp;nbsp;boxes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;RAID&lt;/span&gt; Configuration&lt;/strong&gt; is
accomplished by a normal startup prompt Ctrl+ (C? I don&amp;#8217;t remember) key
sequence, as they&amp;#8217;re x64 machines and it&amp;#8217;s a standard &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RAID&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;controller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Serial Management&lt;/strong&gt; is great -
just connect (in &lt;a href="http://www.columbia.edu/kermit/ck80.html"&gt;Kermit&lt;/a&gt; I
just had to set speed to 9600 and carrier-watch off) and you get a
prompt that looks like &lt;code&gt;SUNSP001E682F6311 login:&lt;/code&gt;. The numbers are the
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;MAC&lt;/span&gt; address of the management interface (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SP&lt;/span&gt;). The default login is
root:changeme, as per Sun doc 819-1155-16. When you login, you&amp;#8217;ll see
the current firmware version (4.0.06 as my box&amp;nbsp;shipped).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Getting a System Console&lt;/strong&gt; - on
the x4100, at the iLOM prompt, &lt;code&gt;cd /SP/console&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;start /SYS&lt;/code&gt; to boot
the system, and then &lt;code&gt;start&lt;/code&gt; to get the console. On the x4150, we must
start &lt;code&gt;/SP/AgentInfo/Console&lt;/code&gt;, and use &lt;code&gt;Esc+Shift+9&lt;/code&gt; to get away from
the&amp;nbsp;console.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="sun"></category><category term="sunfire"></category></entry><entry><title>SunSPOT Update</title><link href="http://blog.jasonantman.com/2008/05/sunspot-update/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2008-05-15T16:04:00-04:00</published><updated>2008-05-15T16:04:00-04:00</updated><author><name>admin</name></author><id>tag:blog.jasonantman.com,2008-05-15:/2008/05/sunspot-update/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Well, I got the SPOTs working on my system.

running OpenSuSE 10.1 and my eeePC. It looks like I just killed my new
install on the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;8GB&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SDHC&lt;/span&gt; card, so I gave the desktop a try. I&amp;#8217;d already
tried once with the install of Orange from the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CD&lt;/span&gt; that came with them,
and had NetBeans 6 installed, so I had to do some recovery. The
procedure was as&amp;nbsp;follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install all of the Java6 java-sun packages (specifically the base as&amp;nbsp;devel).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Download the Java 6 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JDK&lt;/span&gt; from Sun, and install all of the&amp;nbsp;RPMs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Screw with /usr/lib/jvm and get it sane - specifically, replace all
    of the symlinks that point to /etc/alternatives with new ones
    pointing to the Java6 install in&amp;nbsp;/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.6.0-sun-1.6.0&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Delete your entire .netbeans directory (I was having serious issues
    with&amp;nbsp;NetBeans).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start NetBeans from the command line with an explicitly set jdkhome:
    &amp;#8220;netbeans &amp;#8212;jdkhome&amp;nbsp;/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.6.0-sun-1.6.0&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Download the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SPOT&lt;/span&gt; plugin for NetBeans, following the instructions on
    &lt;a href="http://weblogs.java.net/blog/brunogh/archive/2008/04/starting_with_s.html"&gt;Bruno Ghisi&amp;#8217;s
    blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once installed, you should have a little &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SPOT&lt;/span&gt;-looking icon on the
    toolbar below &amp;#8220;Navigate&amp;#8221;. Click on it, and launch SPOTManager from
    the link in the right panel (&amp;#8220;Sun SPOTs Info&amp;#8221;, the link is an icon
    not text). Go through whatever configuration is&amp;nbsp;needed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Upgrade local &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SDK&lt;/span&gt; to Purple (Click the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SDK&lt;/span&gt; tab, select &amp;#8220;v3.0 Purple&amp;#8221;
    from the right panel, click the Upgrade button near the&amp;nbsp;bottom).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Upgrade your demos following davidgs&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href="http://blogs.sun.com/davidgs/entry/beta_follow_up"&gt;blog
    posting&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Upgrade all of the SPOTs to Purple (plug them in one at a time, on
    the SPOTManager SunSPOTs tab, click&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8220;Upgrade&amp;#8221;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;#8217;m still having some minor issues here. I&amp;#8217;ll update when I have
    everything figured&amp;nbsp;out&amp;#8230;&lt;/li&gt;

entries when I get back into the swing of things). I&amp;#8217;ve been pretty
busy, between studying, projects, and work. I&amp;#8217;ll be working 4 days a
week through June 20th, as well as taking night classes 4 nigths a week
(unfortunately not the same 4 days) through July 3, in an effort to
graduate Rutgers on time (after transferring in and also switching
majors). Work after June 20th is up in the air - who knows how hard the
budget cuts will&amp;nbsp;hit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My internship as the Sun Microsystems Campus Ambassador to Rutgers is
over on May 12th. I got a chance to do the Rutgers &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IT&lt;/span&gt; Vendor Fair with
Sun, and met a few cool people - especially including Matt McGrath of
&lt;a href="http://www.conres.com/"&gt;Continental Resources&lt;/a&gt;, a Sun Strategic iForce
Partner, who&amp;#8217;s doing some wonderful things with the &lt;a href="http://www.sun.com/solutions/landing/industry/education/edu_essentials.jsp"&gt;Sun Education
Essentials Matching Grant
Program&lt;/a&gt;,
and &lt;a href="http://opsamericas.com/"&gt;Skip Paul&lt;/a&gt;, a Linux Systems Engineer for
Novell&amp;#8217;s Open Platform Solutions group. I also finally cracked open my
demo set of &lt;a href="http://www.sunspotworld.com/"&gt;SunSPOT&lt;/a&gt;s. Wonderful little
devices, radio, run Java on the bare metal, and have temperature
sensors, accelerometers, and liberal I/O. My first development exereice
will probably be making a temperature and acceleration data logger for
my truck, but there&amp;#8217;s surely more to come. They&amp;#8217;re&amp;nbsp;great!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My newest project - which I&amp;#8217;m hoping to spend nearly the whole summer on
- is the &lt;a href="http://www.jasonantman.com/tuxtruck/"&gt;TuxTruck&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;#8217;ve been
frustrated with the lack of &amp;#8220;smartness&amp;#8221; in my truck (an 06 Ford F-250),
not to mention having to remember my &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MP3&lt;/span&gt; player so I can listen to
podcasts on the way to work, and having so many gadgets in my truck. So,
the solution is obvious: a Linux-based
&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpc"&gt;CarPC&lt;/a&gt;. A nice little Mini-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ATX&lt;/span&gt; box
under a seat, with a 7&amp;#8221; pull-out touchscreen in the dash (replacing the
factory radio). It&amp;#8217;s a big, complicated, and expensive project - but I
want one, and I could use some experience with smaller systems.&lt;br&gt;
The major features I have&amp;nbsp;planned:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Realtime &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPS&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;navigation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hands-free bluetooth calls from my cell, with address book, routing
    to contact address, possibly voice&amp;nbsp;dialing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Realtime&amp;nbsp;weather&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;OBD&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;II&lt;/span&gt; interface, for vehicle diagnostics and fuel
    efficiency/performance&amp;nbsp;profiling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Audio - at a minimum searching and playing MP3s, and automatically
    downloading podcasts and throwing them in a playlist. Perhaps also
    an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AM&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;FM&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;tuner&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s not an easy project. So far, the major challenges seem to&amp;nbsp;be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No full-featured &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPS&lt;/span&gt; navigation package available. The ones that are
    available don&amp;#8217;t seem to be too easy to integrate into my planned
    &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GUI&lt;/span&gt;, which will allot them 800x420 pixels (on an 800x480 screen) and
    requre the bottom toolbar to be always&amp;nbsp;available.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to handle processing of multiple data streams that require
    near-real-time processing - specifically, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPS&lt;/span&gt; with text-to-speech,
    turn-by-turn directions, plus playing audio, plus responding to an
    incoming phone call in a timely manner, pausing the audio, and
    stopping &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPS&lt;/span&gt; audio but continuing&amp;nbsp;navigation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whether to install a smaller stereo and use aux input for audio, or
    totally rip out the stereo, use an amp with the computer as its only
    input, and then how to control&amp;nbsp;volume?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be more to come in the future. For now, take a look at &lt;a href="https://github.com/jantman/tuxtruck"&gt;the
TuxTruck github&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update Saturday, March 2, 2013&lt;/strong&gt; - I&amp;#8217;m in the process of migrating my
legacy &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CVS&lt;/span&gt; and Subversion repositories to
&lt;a href="http://github.com/jantman/"&gt;github.com&lt;/a&gt;. The forgotten &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SVN&lt;/span&gt; repository
for TuxTruck has been migrated there, and the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CVS&lt;/span&gt; repository will soon
be moved there as well. Tuxtruck.org has been permanently taken offline
and redirected to the GitHub&amp;nbsp;repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mediawiki Logging&lt;/strong&gt; - I recently
had a situation where I had to confirm how much work someone had done on
a MediaWiki-based project. The Recent Changes page only goes back 30
days, and walking through the History of each page is a pain. After
looking around in the database a bit, I found a few tables of&amp;nbsp;interest:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Table &amp;#8220;users&amp;#8221; includes fields &amp;#8220;user_touched&amp;#8221; (last time the user
    was updated) and &amp;#8220;user_editcount&amp;#8221; (a really simple count of the
    users&amp;#8217; number of&amp;nbsp;edits).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Table &amp;#8220;recentchanges&amp;#8221; holds a lot of data&amp;#8230; seemingly the entire
    life of the&amp;nbsp;wiki&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This Sunday, March 30&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, the &lt;a href="http://ruslug.rutgers.edu/w/"&gt;Rutgers University Student Linux Users&amp;#8217;
Group&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;RUSLUG&lt;/span&gt;) will be hosting our annual
Installfest in the &lt;a href="http://ruslug.rutgers.edu/w/EitDirections"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;EIT&lt;/span&gt; Lab&lt;/a&gt;
from 10 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AM&lt;/span&gt; until 6 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PM&lt;/span&gt;. While the event is generally marketed towards
Linux newbies, it&amp;#8217;s usually attended by a diverse range of students (and
staff) from first-timers to Solaris sysadmins. I&amp;#8217;ll be attendance, as
always, and will also be conducting some demos of new Sun technology
(mainly OpenSolaris and NetBeans). For anyone in the New
Brunswick/Pisctaway area, I&amp;#8217;ll also be armed with some door prizes and a
whole plethora of CDs and DVDs. For anyone interested, I&amp;#8217;ll be providing
information and pointers on NetBeans and Solaris, as well as
installation assistance (and maybe some prizes) for anyone looking to
give OpenSolaris a whirl on their&amp;nbsp;system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following up the Installfest, on Tuesday, April 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; at 9 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PM&lt;/span&gt; (also in
the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EIT&lt;/span&gt; lab) will be the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RUSLUG&lt;/span&gt; Newbie Night. It&amp;#8217;s generally a
fun-filled evening with &lt;a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/"&gt;Ubuntu&lt;/a&gt; LiveCDs and a
general Q&amp;amp;A session about Linux. Generally this includes one-on-one
assistance for new Linux users. In an effort to raise the level of
content (and provide a diversion for more experienced users if there
aren&amp;#8217;t many new faces), I&amp;#8217;ll be once again demo&amp;#8217;ing some Sun technology,
and specifically providing an overview of my recently completed personal
mailserver migration from SuSE Linux to OpenSolaris. Once again,
visitors can expect some door prizes and lots of fun CDs to take&amp;nbsp;home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;RUSLUG&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s current box,
    &lt;a href="http://ruslug.rutgers.edu/"&gt;ruslug.rutgers.edu&lt;/a&gt;, is a Dell desktop
    thrown on a shelf in a closet. I&amp;#8217;d like to find someone willing to
    help out with procuring a new box. It doesn&amp;#8217;t need to be anything
    fancy - just pretty simple, though I&amp;#8217;d like to look into high
    capacity storage for mirroring distros. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FYI&lt;/span&gt;, the current box is a
    Dell desktop with a 1.7GHz P-4 (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;256KB&lt;/span&gt; cache), 512 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MB&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RAM&lt;/span&gt;, and about
    &lt;span class="caps"&gt;250GB&lt;/span&gt; of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IDE&lt;/span&gt; storage (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;150GB&lt;/span&gt; + &lt;span class="caps"&gt;100GB&lt;/span&gt;, no &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RAID&lt;/span&gt;). We don&amp;#8217;t need a big
    upgrade in processor power, but more &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RAM&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RAID&lt;/span&gt; for the system and
    user disks would be nice (distro mirrors can be a big &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IDE&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SATA&lt;/span&gt; or an
    external&amp;nbsp;disk).&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;#8217;t had much time this week to do anything interesting - it&amp;#8217;s been
a busy week for class-related stuff, and a bunch of work-related stuff
too. So, I guess I&amp;#8217;ll just post some interesting links for the past few&amp;nbsp;days&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sun.com/aboutsun/pr/2008-02/sunflash.20080212.1.xml"&gt;Sun Microsystems has announced that we&amp;#8217;ll be acquiring
Innotek&lt;/a&gt;,
and therefore VirtualBox. This means that Sun&amp;#8217;s virtualization products
will now reach to the desktop - and that I should give VirtualBox a shot
for running OpenSolaris on my laptop. (aside: why is virtualization not
in my Firefox spell check&amp;nbsp;yet???)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers at the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center have come out with
&lt;a href="http://www.psc.edu/networking/projects/hpn-ssh/"&gt;a version of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SSH&lt;/span&gt; / &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SCP&lt;/span&gt; that uses

&lt;a href="http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20080211-vista-capable-scheme-was-panned-at-microsoft.html"&gt;Ars Technica ran an article on the Vista Capable

with some comments from &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MS&lt;/span&gt; insiders. How is it that such a big company,
with such a ubiquitous product, can constantly be sued, have &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MAJOR&lt;/span&gt;
screwups, screw over their customers, and still people come back for&amp;nbsp;more?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m also catching up on all of my &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RSS&lt;/span&gt; feeds in &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/reader/"&gt;Google
Reader&lt;/a&gt; (yes, I use Google everything -
but not mail or Docs) which I mostly ignored over break. I started
yesterday with 780 items, and I&amp;#8217;m down to 500. I&amp;#8217;m also going to attempt
to start quick little &amp;#8220;links of the day&amp;#8221; entries, as it seems that it&amp;#8217;s
taking me too much time to fully blog on the interesting news of the
day, and my&lt;a href="http://del.icio.us/jantman/1-toblog"&gt;list of things to blog
on&lt;/a&gt; is getting way too long. (Just
as a side note, the only reason I really use
&lt;a href="http://del.icio.us"&gt;del.icio.us&lt;/a&gt; is so I can have the &lt;a href="http://del.icio.us/help/firefox/extensionnew"&gt;firefox
plugin&lt;/a&gt; sync my bookmarks
between the many machines I&amp;nbsp;use.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, on to the hottest bit of news today - &lt;a href="http://www.sun.com"&gt;Sun
Microsystems&lt;/a&gt; has acqured &lt;a href="http://www.mysql.com/"&gt;MySQL
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AB&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Now, I must say that I&amp;#8217;m an intern at Sun -
the Campus Ambassador to Rutgers University. Essentially, my job is
talking to students, professors, and staff and telling them that &amp;#8220;Yes,
Sun does open source, and they have a few things that should interest
you&amp;#8221; - in addition to giving tech demos, handing out CDs, and raffling
off t-shirts - and even a &lt;a href="http://www.sunspotworld.com/"&gt;SunSPOT&lt;/a&gt;. I
must emphasize that what I say here is my own opinion and nothing more.
Heck, I&amp;#8217;m an intern, it&amp;#8217;s not like I know any more about what&amp;#8217;s going on
at Sun than anyone else who reads&amp;nbsp;Digg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, lots of people are talking about the MySQL acquisition. I&amp;#8217;ve
heard every possible opinion, but it seems like lots of them are
worrying about something along the lines of Sun pushing a
Solaris/Apache/MySQL/Java stack on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SPARC&lt;/span&gt; hardware. Now, I&amp;#8217;ve been
watching Sun *very* closely for the past year or so. And I&amp;#8217;ve been
following &lt;a href="http://www.sun.com/aboutsun/executives/schwartz/bio.jsp"&gt;Jonathan
Schwartz&lt;/a&gt;
pretty closely too, especially &lt;a href="http://blogs.sun.com/jonathan/entry/in_a_vortex"&gt;his blog post about the MySQL
acquisition&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#8217;t say anything as a Sun employee (I don&amp;#8217;t have anything more to
say than anyone else who follows the news) but, personally, I think a
lot of people who are worried are just missing the point. Sun used to be
a closed, proprietary company pushing Solaris on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SPARC&lt;/span&gt;. But it seems to
me, lately, Sun is all about options. Java&amp;#8217;s Free software now. Solaris
&lt;a href="http://www.opensolaris.org"&gt;has been opened&lt;/a&gt; as well. I don&amp;#8217;t get the
feeling that acquiring MySQL is about pushing Solaris instead of Linux,
or that it will cause Sun to ignore
&lt;a href="http://www.postgresql.org/"&gt;PostgreSQL&lt;/a&gt; or Oracle/Solaris products.
It&amp;#8217;s about options. Just look at Sun in the news lately - more and more
Intel-based commodity hardware, Solaris, Linux, or even Windows on Sun
Hardware, Java,&amp;nbsp;OpenSolaris&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I very much get the feeling that Sun/MySQL is not about Sun trying to
force &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LAMP&lt;/span&gt; out of the marketplace or, as some have conjectured, to turn
MySQL into a mostly proprietary product with minimal free version. It
seems to be about options. About diversity. Whatever you want, Sun can
help. Everything from million-dollar Enterprise servers running &lt;a href="http://www.sun.com/software/solaris/trustedsolaris/"&gt;Trusted
Solaris&lt;/a&gt; and giant
Oracle databases to Intel-based 1U or 2U &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LAMP&lt;/span&gt; servers - or even, now,
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;LAMP&lt;/span&gt; servers on non-Sun hardware. (Though why anyone with the money to
do so wouldn&amp;#8217;t buy Sun hardware, I have no&amp;nbsp;idea).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="problem-1-nvram-password-set-impossible-to-install-an-os"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#problem-1-nvram-password-set-impossible-to-install-an-os"&gt;Problem 1 - &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NVRAM&lt;/span&gt; password set, impossible to install an&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;OS&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of googling, and asking for advice. Eventually, I came
by a forum post expressing success with a procedure of pulling out and
then re-inserting the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NVRAM&lt;/span&gt; *while* the system is powered on. This
left my system un-bootable. I pulled the chip again, and found two pins
bent. I straightened them, re-inserted, and rebooted using the Stop+N
Equivalent Functionality (after powering on the system, once you hear
the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;POST&lt;/span&gt; beep, click the power button twice quickly). This temporarily
resets the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NVRAM&lt;/span&gt; to default settings. I found that the password was
gone, and was able to issue the &amp;#8220;set-defaults&amp;#8221; command at the &amp;#8220;ok&gt;&amp;#8221;
prompt. I then popped in the Solaris 10 install &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CD&lt;/span&gt;, issued the
&amp;#8220;reset-all&amp;#8221; command to reboot, and used Stop+A at boot to bring up a
boot menu, and told it to boot from &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CDROM&lt;/span&gt; (&amp;#8220;boot cdrom&amp;#8221;). Installation
then&amp;nbsp;started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="problem-2-invalid-nvram"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#problem-2-invalid-nvram"&gt;Problem 2 - Invalid&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NVRAM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the above procedure, when booting, I got a message following the
Sun banner stating that there was a problem with the IDprom checksum.
When the install &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CD&lt;/span&gt; booted, I also got messages stating &amp;#8220;Invalid format
code in IDprom&amp;#8221;, &amp;#8220;Warning: IDprom checksum error&amp;#8221;, and &amp;#8220;os-io Invalid
format code in IDprom&amp;#8221;. After another five hours of work, I found that
it&amp;#8217;s essentially something I have to live with. While OpenBoot previous
to version 4 allowed use of the &amp;#8220;mkp&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;mkpl&amp;#8221; commands to directly
write the IDprom, version 4 and above allows no access to this. The
IDprom was reporting an ethernet (mac) address of all zeros.
Unfortunately, there seems to be no way to correct this as far as I&amp;#8217;ve
found. However, it didn&amp;#8217;t effect my &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OS&lt;/span&gt; installation&amp;#8230;&amp;nbsp;much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*There may be a way to access the IDprom through OpenBoot 4.x, but I
couldn&amp;#8217;t find any reference to it online, and couldn&amp;#8217;t figure out the
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;FORTH&lt;/span&gt; commands from the reference&amp;nbsp;docs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some helpful links for the above problems include the OpenBoot 4.x
Command Reference Manual, currently found
&lt;a href="http://dlc.sun.com/pdf/816-1177-10/816-1177-10.pdf"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, as well as
the Sun Blade 150 Service Manual (from
&lt;a href="http://docs.sun.com/"&gt;docs.sun.com&lt;/a&gt;), document 816-4379-10, currently
indexed with the Sun Blade 150 docs
&lt;a href="http://docs.sun.com/app/docs/coll/sb150"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. It was also
interesting, in my search for help, to look at the OpenBoot 3.x Command
Manual, and see how easy it was to re-write the IDprom on older Sun
Blade&amp;nbsp;workstations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pleaese note that the advice given in the &lt;a href="http://040.digital-bless.com/texts/Unofficial_Sun_Blade_100_FAQ.htm"&gt;Unofficial SunBlade 100
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;FAQ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
and the &lt;a href="http://www.squirrel.com/sun-nvram-hostid.faq.html"&gt;squirrel.com Sun &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NVRAM&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;FAQ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; doesn&amp;#8217;t seem to
work on the 150 with OpenBoot 4.x. From what I can tell, all of that
advice applies only to OpenBoot&amp;nbsp;3.x!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When booting Solaris, I found that I couldn&amp;#8217;t get &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DHCP&lt;/span&gt;. When I finally
got the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OS&lt;/span&gt; running and logged in as root, I realized something
interesting - I couldn&amp;#8217;t access or ping anything past the one switch I
was connected to. But everything on that switch was fine, pinging both
from and to the Solaris box. I ping&amp;#8217;ed from my laptop, and then thought
to run &amp;#8220;arp -a&amp;#8221;. It showed a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MAC&lt;/span&gt; address of 00:00:00:00:00:00! Running
&amp;#8220;ifconfig -a&amp;#8221; on the Solaris box confirmed this. Luckily, the first time
I booted this box, I wrote down the ethernet address and hostID as shown
on the banner. I ran a quick ifconfig to setup the correct &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MAC&lt;/span&gt;, like
&amp;#8220;ifconfig eri0 ether xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx&amp;#8221;. Networking now worked
perfectly, and I could get to everything on the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LAN&lt;/span&gt; as well as browse
the web. It would be good to somehow reset this in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NVRAM&lt;/span&gt;, but for now
I&amp;#8217;m just going to add it to the startup scripts somewhere. One forum
post that I found suggested adding the previous ifconfig command to the
top of /etc/rc.c/init.d/network, which I&amp;#8217;ve done and will see how it
works at the next&amp;nbsp;boot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="problem-4-cant-login-to-smc-solaris-management-console"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#problem-4-cant-login-to-smc-solaris-management-console"&gt;Problem 4 - Can&amp;#8217;t login to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SMC&lt;/span&gt; (Solaris Management&amp;nbsp;Console)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My next task after getting the system up and running, and getting
networking working, as to give myself a user account. I was logged in
using the Java Desktop System, so I opened a terminal and ran &amp;#8220;smc &amp;amp;&amp;#8221;.
After the usual initialization wait, I loaded the toolboxes for the
local machine, and connected. When I clicked on the &amp;#8220;users&amp;#8221; module and
entered my root password, I got an invalid password / login failed
message. I tried again and again, even checking against the post-it that
I wrote the password on until I memorize it. Nothing. Searching the
forums, I came by this
&lt;a href="http://forum.java.sun.com/thread.jspa?threadID=5104081&amp;amp;messageID=9354742"&gt;post&lt;/a&gt;,
but the value in /etc/security/policy.conf was correctly set to &amp;#8221;
CRYPT_DEFAULT=__unix__&amp;#8221;. So, on a wild hunch, I used &amp;#8220;passwd&amp;#8221; to
reset my password to a shorter one, which I use on a few other
(unimportant) workstations.&amp;nbsp;Magic!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I now have, after two days of work, a working Solaris box. Now that I
have a good &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OS&lt;/span&gt; install, in order to get the other box working, I
*should* just be able to swap HDDs, boot, login as root, and use the
&amp;#8220;eeprom&amp;#8221; command to set &amp;#8220;security-mode&amp;#8221; to &amp;#8220;none&amp;#8221;, bypassing all of this&amp;nbsp;bull****.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="nvram"></category><category term="openboot"></category><category term="password"></category><category term="smc"></category><category term="solaris"></category><category term="sun"></category><category term="sunblade"></category></entry><entry><title>*nix</title><link href="http://blog.jasonantman.com/2007/09/nix/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2007-09-28T13:22:00-04:00</published><updated>2007-09-28T13:22:00-04:00</updated><author><name>admin</name></author><id>tag:blog.jasonantman.com,2007-09-28:/2007/09/nix/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;First off, my Sun blog should be coming sometime this weekend/early next

&lt;p&gt;This morning at work, while reading &lt;a href="http://digg.com"&gt;Digg&lt;/a&gt;, I came by
two interesting links that got me thinking:
&lt;a href="http://www.foogazi.com/2007/09/27/5-reasons-your-parents-should-use-linux/"&gt;5 Reasons Your Parents Should Use
Linux&lt;/a&gt;
and &lt;a href="http://warpedvisions.org/2006/12/30/ten-things-linux-distros-get-right-that-ms-doesnt/"&gt;Ten Things Linux Distros Get Right (That &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MS&lt;/span&gt;
Doesn&amp;#8217;t)&lt;/a&gt;.
Now, I&amp;#8217;ll admit, my *nix experience is pretty much limited to Linux.
I&amp;#8217;ve used &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BSD&lt;/span&gt; a few times, but only as pre-built images for embedded
systems like my &lt;a href="http://www.soekris.com"&gt;Soekris&lt;/a&gt; boxen. I&amp;#8217;ve used
Solaris mainly just as a user/web developer in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SSH&lt;/span&gt; at work. And while I
now have a work computer running Solaris 10 and a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SXDE&lt;/span&gt; image on my
laptop, I&amp;#8217;m still relatively new - and, given that I&amp;#8217;m now doing
hardware support and wireless work, I don&amp;#8217;t even know what I need
another machine in the office&amp;nbsp;for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That being said, the second link got me thinking. Specifically, about
something I read in &lt;a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/taoup/"&gt;The Art of Unix
Programming&lt;/a&gt; [Wikipedia] by
Eric S. Raymond (available online
&lt;a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/taoup/html/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) with regards to
interface design. One quote that I was able to find in the online
version, comes from Chapter 11, under the subtitle &amp;#8220;Tradeoffs between
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CLI&lt;/span&gt; and Visual Interfaces&amp;#8221;, &amp;#8220;Resistance to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CLI&lt;/span&gt; interfaces tends to
decrease as users become more expert. In many problem domains, users
(especially frequent
users) reach a crossover point at which the concision and expressiveness
of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CLI&lt;/span&gt; becomes more valuable than avoiding its mnemonic load. Thus, for
example, computing novices prefer the ease of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GUI&lt;/span&gt; desktops, but
experienced users often gradually discover that they prefer typing
commands to a&amp;nbsp;shell.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is another similar
quote in the book, mentioning how resistance to the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CLI&lt;/span&gt; drops as
&lt;em&gt;typing speed&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;increases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, in some areas I&amp;#8217;m still bound to Windows. Though my only
personal use for it is to control an ancient Umax Mirage IIse &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SCSI&lt;/span&gt;
scanner (with only Windows and Mac drivers), I ultimately need to touch
it now and then - whether on my mother&amp;#8217;s box (she claims she has to have
Windows and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MS&lt;/span&gt; Office because &amp;#8220;that&amp;#8217;s what businesses use&amp;#8221;) or as admin
of the four boxes at the &lt;a href="http://www.midlandparkambulance.com"&gt;Ambulance
Corps&lt;/a&gt; where I&amp;nbsp;volunteer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, whenever I am (unfortunately) pushed into the task of working
on a Windows box, I always feel something lacking. To be blunt, I don&amp;#8217;t
see how experienced users can deal with it. And this isn&amp;#8217;t just an issue
of multiple desktops, or reliability (I expect my desktop to have months
of uptime, and my servers to have years). This isn&amp;#8217;t just pro-Linux,
it&amp;#8217;s anti-Windows. Linux is great. Solaris seems wonderful, and I can&amp;#8217;t
want to move my servers over. And, believe it or not, due to playing
around with the Solaris Management Console, for the first time in 5
years, I plan on running X on my servers.
What this is, is a talk about total workflow. Years ago, I reached the
point where I am more comfortable at the command line, or in an
Ncurses-style &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GUI&lt;/span&gt;, than in&amp;nbsp;X.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I an attribute this to two factors - verbosity and speed. The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CLI&lt;/span&gt; is as
verbose as anything can get. I remember setting a static &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IP&lt;/span&gt; on a Windows
box. I had to navigate the Start menu, open up the control panel, the
network thingy, click on the network card, and work through a series of
dialogs. In Linux, I clicked on the terminal icon, typed &amp;#8220;sudo ifconfig
eth0 up 192.168.0.211&amp;#8221; and then a password. Done. Likewise, refreshing a
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DHCP&lt;/span&gt; lease on Windows requires a whole bunch of &amp;#8220;repair connection&amp;#8221;
nonsense, whereas in Linux all it requires is &amp;#8220;dhclient eth0&amp;#8221;. The
bottom line I know what I&amp;#8217;m doing. Windows should have an option to let
me quickly do&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speed is a related issue. Click, click-click, drag, click, click&amp;#8230;.
what about just typing? Even for people who aren&amp;#8217;t &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CLI&lt;/span&gt;-friendly, there&amp;#8217;s
Ncurses. YaST2, the SuSE/openSuSE administration tool, has both &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GUI&lt;/span&gt; and
Ncurses interfaces. I always use the Ncurses interface. Why? Because
I&amp;#8217;ve been using it for years. I know that if I want to add a user
through YaST, I hit the down arrow 7 times, tab once, down 5, enter. Tab
once more to bring up the add user dialog. I can do this in well under a
second. What&amp;#8217;s the bottom line? Well, first of all, my hands are already
on the keyboard. That&amp;#8217;s where they like to stay. That&amp;#8217;s where they&amp;#8217;re
comfortable. My fingers need to move a *lot* less to navigate with the
arrow keys, tab, and enter than they do to use a mouse. If you know what
you&amp;#8217;re doing, if you already know what you&amp;#8217;re looking for, then a mouse
is slower than the speed of thought (or&amp;nbsp;reaction).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So where&amp;#8217;s the Windows bashing? Simple. How do people at Microsoft deal
with this? How does the guy who *wrote* that network settings dialog
deal with navigating the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GUI&lt;/span&gt; every time, even though he already knows
exactly what he wants to do - and probably the system calls to do&amp;nbsp;it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bottom line is that every time I sit down at a Windows machine, I
wonder how the most popular &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OS&lt;/span&gt; is one that doesn&amp;#8217;t give any thought to
advanced users. I know that I can type faster than I can move a mouse,
why don&amp;#8217;t you let me use that? More importantly, why didn&amp;#8217;t Microsoft
ever think that people would use computers on a network? When I
installed Solaris, I wanted to edit a config file. I hadn&amp;#8217;t customized
&lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; yet, hadn&amp;#8217;t installed any other software, nothing. Yet, I
was able to open up a terminal and grab my .emacs file from my laptop in
one line&amp;nbsp;(scp).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be totally honest, the question running through my mind is something
like &amp;#8220;everything is so much quicker on Linux.

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve just been hired as the Sun Microsystems Campus Ambassador for
Rutgers University. Essentially, my job is to tell students, faculty,
staff, and researchers about Sun&amp;#8217;s open source technologies and what
they can do. This involves giving some tech demos and talks, some
networking, and completing a lot of training on my part. Hopefully also
getting to hand out some neat Sun swag around campus. I have to admit,
I&amp;#8217;ve never been a real fan of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GUI&lt;/span&gt; IDEs - I do pretty much all of my
development (admittedly, very little in Java, most of my work is simple
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt; stuff) on Emacs. That being said, I&amp;#8217;m really pyched about trying
some new stuff like &lt;span class="caps"&gt;J2EE&lt;/span&gt; and maybe some Ruby. However, I also looked
over some of our training materials on the upcoming
&lt;a href="http://www.netbeans.org/"&gt;NetBean&lt;/a&gt;s 6.0, and truthfully, I&amp;#8217;m damn
interested. I haven&amp;#8217;t used a Java &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IDE&lt;/span&gt; since three years ago in high
school, and it looks as though they&amp;#8217;ve come a very long&amp;nbsp;way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m also really getting into Solaris. The new
&lt;a href="http://www.opensolaris.org"&gt;openSolaris&lt;/a&gt; / Solaris Express releases
have a lot of great features - and I can&amp;#8217;t want to get my hands on a
machine running Zones, Containers, and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ZFS&lt;/span&gt;, just to mention a few
technologies. I setup Solaris 10 on one of my work computers, and I&amp;#8217;m
hooked. It&amp;#8217;s fine for a desktop, but I can honestly say that after a few
minutes playing around with the Solaris Management Console, I&amp;#8217;m
seriously considering ditching SuSE (now OpenSuSE) which I&amp;#8217;ve been using
as a server &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OS&lt;/span&gt; for some 7 years, and switching over to&amp;nbsp;Solaris.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, Solaris is really an enterprise &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OS&lt;/span&gt;. That means it has
loads of wonderful features that are also rock-solid, and was designed
with the idea of centrally-administered servers in mind - something that
SuSE only caught onto recently. However, that also means that it is
intended to run on what I would call &amp;#8220;new&amp;#8221; hardware. In other words,
don&amp;#8217;t look to put Solaris 10 or Solaris Express (openSolaris / Solaris
11) on your 386. And if you&amp;#8217;re like me and running something along the
lines of a Generation 1 Compaq Proliant &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ML370&lt;/span&gt; with a 2nd-generation
SmartArray &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RAID&lt;/span&gt; controller (a system that was made about 10 years ago),
you might have some issues. It appears that the &amp;#8216;smartii&amp;#8217; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RAID&lt;/span&gt; driver
(and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EISA&lt;/span&gt; support) was removed from Solaris 10 in 6/06. The solution?
I&amp;#8217;m going to be looking into buying a bunch of new systems, possibly
Dell PowerEdge servers and, if I can get the cash, a few Sun&amp;nbsp;systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, within the week, I&amp;#8217;ll be setting up a blog at
&lt;a href="http://blogs.sun.com"&gt;blogs.sun.com&lt;/a&gt;. This will probably contain a lot
of Rutgers-specific information, but will also most definitely include
my notes on Sun products, and a healthy amount of Solaris-related&amp;nbsp;information.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="solaris"></category><category term="sun"></category></entry></feed>
