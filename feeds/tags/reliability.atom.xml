My current system and code has grown organically over time and is not how I&amp;#8217;d approach this if I started over from scratch. My code and system has a few obvious vulnerabilities and probably some non-obvious ones as well; I humbly but sincerely ask that you do not attempt to exploit these. I highly recommend that anyone implementing a similar system - especially if you also publish the details of it - have undocumented backup systems/devices. Finally, the systems that I describe are intended to provide some protection against or notification of crimes of opportunity, not targeted attacks. Please keep in mind that none of this is intended to protect against someone who targets &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt; specifically (and takes the time to research me) as opposed to my home at random.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While my &lt;a href="/2018/12/aws-reinvent-2018-my-experience-and-recommendations-for-next-time/"&gt;trip to the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWS&lt;/span&gt; re:Invent conference last month&lt;/a&gt; resulted in a giant pile of swag from the expo, by far the most interesting of it was from the communications company &lt;a href="https://www.twilio.com"&gt;Twilio&lt;/a&gt; that gave me a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SIM&lt;/span&gt; card for their &lt;a href="https://www.twilio.com/wireless"&gt;Programmable Wireless&lt;/a&gt; service (as well as something else that will be the topic of at least one future post). Programmable Wireless is really cool: for $3 per &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SIM&lt;/span&gt; and $3 per month (in &lt;strong&gt;single unit&lt;/strong&gt; quantity) I get a 2G/3G/4G &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SIM&lt;/span&gt; card with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;20MB&lt;/span&gt; of monthly data. That&amp;#8217;s not much data in the world of smartphones, but it&amp;#8217;s more than enough for many IoT or embedded use cases. More importantly, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SIM&lt;/span&gt; is also tied to your Twilio account that provides customizable rate plans (data rates, quotas, and roaming configuration) and detailed bi-hourly breakdowns of upload and download transfer, as well as &lt;a href="https://www.twilio.com/docs/usage/api"&gt;ReST APIs&lt;/a&gt; to manage everything and retrieve usage information and &lt;a href="https://www.twilio.com/docs/wireless"&gt;wonderful documentation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, at re:Invent one of the Twilio folks was telling me about their new Programmable Wireless service and the low costs even for a single &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SIM&lt;/span&gt;, and it occurred to me that this would be the perfect solution for an out-of-band notification solution for my &lt;a href="/2018/08/home-automation-and-security-system-overview/"&gt;home automation and security system&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="/tags/security/index.html"&gt;blog posts in the &amp;#8220;security&amp;#8221; category&lt;/a&gt;). I&amp;#8217;ve done quite a bit this year with automation and security for my house, as well as video surveillance. I&amp;#8217;ve handled a lot of reasonable failure scenarios including power outage but, while my &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AT&lt;/span&gt;&amp;amp;T fiber connection has been remarkably reliable so far, loss of connectivity was the one major issue I didn&amp;#8217;t have a working solution for. My needs in the case of a loss of connectivity are somewhat different from the normal day-to-day; it&amp;#8217;s a rare enough condition that I&amp;#8217;m not really concerned with getting massive collections of surveillance camera still images like usual, but just a simple alert when connectivity is lost or restored, or if the alarm is triggered when my primary Internet connection is offline. Within those constraints it seemed like Programmable Wireless would be perfect for my needs, especially at the $3 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USD&lt;/span&gt;/month price tag for a one-off personal&amp;nbsp;project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago, before going out of state for a week, I purchased the Huawei E397u-53 unlocked &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USB&lt;/span&gt; 4G &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LTE&lt;/span&gt; modem on &lt;a href="https://www.twilio.com/docs/wireless/tutorials/compatible-hardware"&gt;Twilio&amp;#8217;s compatible hardware list&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01M0JY15V/"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and started work on the project. At first I spun my wheels for quite a while trying to figure out a way to handle the insane routing that I wanted in Linux: route everything out the default gateway (my &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LAN&lt;/span&gt;, going to my router and out the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AT&lt;/span&gt;&amp;amp;T Fiber uplink) when it&amp;#8217;s working, but when the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AT&lt;/span&gt;&amp;amp;T link is down, route only certain &amp;#8220;special&amp;#8221; traffic through the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USB&lt;/span&gt; modem. After a bunch of thinking in circles and researching - and digging into all sorts of ugly stuff like policy-based routing - I resorted to posting a question on Twitter. Luckily a brilliant engineer who I used to work with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/j_metzmeier/status/1076234692167454721"&gt;pointed me in the right direction&lt;/a&gt; with Docker. After thinking through his suggestion for a comparatively short amount of time, I hit on the solution that I&amp;#8217;m currently&amp;nbsp;using.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My solution was to run a lightweight &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTTP&lt;/span&gt;(S) proxy server (&lt;a href="https://tinyproxy.github.io/"&gt;tinyproxy&lt;/a&gt;) inside a Docker container, with the container running in privileged mode and the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PPP&lt;/span&gt; connection managed inside the container. Since it&amp;#8217;s running in privileged mode, the Docker container has full access to the host devices including the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USB&lt;/span&gt; modem. When the container starts it launches &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point-to-Point_Protocol_daemon"&gt;pppd&lt;/a&gt; which establishes the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PPP&lt;/span&gt; link over the cellular modem, sets a new default route over the link, and then starts tinyproxy (adding some other routes to the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LAN&lt;/span&gt; as needed). The container exposes port 8888 for tinyproxy, which allows &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTTP&lt;/span&gt;(S) traffic to be routed over the cellular link just by using the container as a proxy. I handle the failover component at the application level, by attempting to send data over the default route a certain number of times and then falling back to the proxy if all attempts failed (&lt;a href="https://github.com/jantman/home-automation-configs/commit/2cf9eb933969f7527786393703e91f0a32538deb"&gt;example commit&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My solution to this is still very rough around the edges and shows all the unfortunate signs of being thrown together in a single rushed evening, but the &lt;a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/jantman/twilio-ppp-proxy"&gt;jantman/twilio-ppp-proxy Docker image&lt;/a&gt; and corresponding &lt;a href="https://github.com/jantman/docker-twilio-ppp-proxy"&gt;GitHub repo&lt;/a&gt; are available for anyone who would like to use them; I hope to polish them up a bit in the near future. While my needs are somewhat specific, I hope this will be of assistance to anyone else who wants the ability to easily proxy certain traffic over a Twilio Programmable Wireless link while preserving their existing&amp;nbsp;routing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most importantly, many many thanks to the folks at the Twilio booth at re:Invent (I really, really wish I remembered the name of the person I spoke to) for discussing their services with me and giving me the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SIM&lt;/span&gt; card that got this project&amp;nbsp;started!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="twilio"></category><category term="wireless"></category><category term="cellular"></category><category term="4G"></category><category term="DIY"></category><category term="security"></category><category term="reliability"></category><category term="alarm"></category></entry><entry><title>Downtime past few days, coping with storms</title><link href="https://blog.jasonantman.com/2010/03/downtime-past-few-days-coping-with-storms/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-03-17T22:27:00-04:00</published><updated>2010-03-17T22:27:00-04:00</updated><author><name>admin</name></author><id>tag:blog.jasonantman.com,2010-03-17:/2010/03/downtime-past-few-days-coping-with-storms/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;As far as I can see from &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/"&gt;Google

noticed (except by me, and my mailserver&amp;#8230;). As many of you in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt;
may know, New Jersey was hit by a pretty big nor&amp;#8217;easter last weekend and
my area was
&lt;a href="http://www.northjersey.com/news/bergen/87665172_Weekend_storm_thrashes_Wyckoff.html"&gt;especially&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.northjersey.com/news/87704777_Ridgewood_power_outages_could_last_for_days.html"&gt;hard&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.northjersey.com/news/87852727_Downed_trees__power_lines_bring_Glen_Rock_to_a_near_standstill.html"&gt;hit&lt;/a&gt;.
I lost power for about five hours Saturday night (the 13th) and again
for an hour or so the next morning. Needless to say, these were both
much longer than my small UPSes could cope with (the smaller of the two
has a mere 12 minutes of runtime with brand new batteries). While I do
have a small (2500W) gas generator, it was buried in the back of the
garage. The time it would take to dig it out and string extension cords
from the UPSes to a relatively dry area outside would probably be more
than 12 minutes - not to mention that as first lieutenant
(second-in-command) of the town&amp;#8217;s volunteer &lt;a href="http://www.midlandparkambulance.com/"&gt;ambulance
corps&lt;/a&gt;, I was running in the
opposite direction once things got&amp;nbsp;bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily, the problems caused or uncovered by the power loss were
relatively&amp;nbsp;minor:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The batteries in my smaller &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UPS&lt;/span&gt; lasted about 90 seconds. I&amp;#8217;d noticed
    the bad battery light a few weeks ago, but put it off (hey, it&amp;#8217;s my
    home setup, I don&amp;#8217;t exactly have a budget).
    &lt;a href="http://www.refurbups.com"&gt;RefurbUPS&lt;/a&gt;, where I got the two &lt;span class="caps"&gt;APC&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SU1000NET&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s, got me a replacement &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RBC6&lt;/span&gt; (aftermarket, not original
    &lt;span class="caps"&gt;APC&lt;/span&gt;) in two days, for around $73. Unfortunately, my Tripp Lite
    &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SMART2200RMXL2U&lt;/span&gt; (unfortunately without the external battery pack)
    also just had its orange light pop on, so there goes another&amp;nbsp;$90.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The battery replacement caused another short (\~5 minute) downtime
    tonight, including my router. Unfortunately the router is plugged
    into the smaller of the two UPSes, and none of my current boxes have
    more than one power supply. Mistake. Especially considering my
    limited resources. On the positive side, I took the opportunity to
    move all of the equipment onto &lt;a href="http://www.liebert.com/product_pages/Product.aspx?id=6&amp;amp;hz=60"&gt;Liebert
    MicroPOD&lt;/a&gt;s.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The external &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SATA&lt;/span&gt; disk for my desktop used to store media is dead.
    I&amp;#8217;m getting incessant read errors, followed by offlining the disk,
    on two &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USB&lt;/span&gt; adapters and internal &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SATA&lt;/span&gt;. I guess I should have a
    better surge protector for the&amp;nbsp;desktop.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A few of my boxes didn&amp;#8217;t come up clean, mainly due to entropy in the
    configs, or services that were never &lt;code&gt;chkconfig&lt;/code&gt;&amp;#8216;ed. Well, I don&amp;#8217;t
    use any configuration management at&amp;nbsp;home.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One of the disks in my storage server (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;RAID&lt;/span&gt; 1+0 of 6x 36.4Gb 10k &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RPM&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SCSI&lt;/span&gt; disks) died - actually a few days before the power outage. I
    was able to find a new replacement on Ebay, with warranty, for about&amp;nbsp;$40.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many of my internal services - including a lot of the
    &lt;a href="http://www.nagios.org"&gt;Nagios&lt;/a&gt; checks - use a separate gigabit
    management network, run off of an older GigE aggregation switch.
    This was on the smaller &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UPS&lt;/span&gt;, so it went down quick. As both this and
    my main switch are of the same series, perhaps an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RPS&lt;/span&gt; unit would be
    worth the&amp;nbsp;money.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plans for the&amp;nbsp;future:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get &lt;a href="http://reductivelabs.com/products/puppet/"&gt;Puppet&lt;/a&gt; working at
    home. As part of this, buy a spare server so I can migrate services
    one at a time to a puppet-ized version, test, and then rebuild
    (while the production machine is still&amp;nbsp;running).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the future, given my limited infrastructure, purchasing dual
    power supply machines - and putting the PSes on separate UPSes -
    would be a good&amp;nbsp;thing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Configure the Tripp Lite &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UPS&lt;/span&gt; to do load&amp;nbsp;shedding.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Setup &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UPS&lt;/span&gt; management software to bring down boxes in a logical&amp;nbsp;order.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Power savings is also important - so I&amp;#8217;m thinking about rebuilding
    things using &lt;a href="http://www.xen.org/"&gt;Xen&lt;/a&gt;, and using live migration to
    both distribute load logically under normal circumstances, and to
    move around loads in the event of power failure (kill
    non-critical/internal-only stuff, consolidate the&amp;nbsp;rest).&lt;/li&gt;
