amazingly full-featured and has a good set of options. I had to manually
change a few things in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CSS&lt;/span&gt; (I wanted to tweak the top bar colors a
bit in a way that&amp;#8217;s not supported in the options), but overall it was a
very simple transition. While it&amp;#8217;s unfortunately very far from valid
&lt;a href="http://validator.w3.org/check?verbose=1&amp;amp;uri=http://blog.jasonantman.com/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

it seems quite&amp;nbsp;nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you happen to read this post and see anything wrong with the theme,
or it doesn&amp;#8217;t display properly for you, please leave a comment below

&lt;p&gt;My next project, continuing on from my &lt;a href="/2012/03/inaccuracies-in-google-analytics-for-website-stats/"&gt;Inaccuracies in Google Analytics
for Website
Stats&lt;/a&gt;
post, is to compare the two self-hosted JavaScript-based open source
Google Analytics alternatives I&amp;#8217;ve identified
(&lt;a href="http://piwik.org/"&gt;Piwik&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.openwebanalytics.com/"&gt;Open Web
Analytics&lt;/a&gt;) and try one out on my site
(keeping in mind that my server is pretty heavily loaded, and I don&amp;#8217;t
want to push it over the edge). Once I come to some sort of conclusion
on that, I&amp;#8217;ll get back to some useful&amp;nbsp;posts.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="blog"></category><category term="theme"></category><category term="wordpress"></category></entry><entry><title>Some Thoughts on Choosing a New Wordpress Theme</title><link href="https://blog.jasonantman.com/2012/03/some-thoughts-on-choosing-a-new-wordpress-theme/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2012-03-17T11:48:00-04:00</published><updated>2012-03-17T11:48:00-04:00</updated><author><name>admin</name></author><id>tag:blog.jasonantman.com,2012-03-17:/2012/03/some-thoughts-on-choosing-a-new-wordpress-theme/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I think I&amp;#8217;m going to choose a new theme for my blog.

is &lt;a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/inove"&gt;iNove&lt;/a&gt; (albeit an older
version with some custom modifications), and I feel like it looks a bit
messy and has gotten a bit cluttered, so it&amp;#8217;s time to find something
new. I like the 2-column layout, and have a few other things I&amp;#8217;m looking
for - specifically, aside from something with advanced features like
lots of widget support and hooks, something that has good visual
separation between different posts and widgets. I also really want
something, if possible, with relative column widths. My current home and
work desktops both have dual monitors, and the minimum resolution I have
on one screen is 1920x1080. When I look at my blog in a maximized
window, about half the screen width is wasted with empty space. So,
ideally, I&amp;#8217;d like a theme that&amp;#8217;s based on relative widths, probably with
a &amp;#8220;min-width&amp;#8221; property so it wouldn&amp;#8217;t get compressed to an absurdly
narrow width on small&amp;nbsp;screens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/"&gt;Google Analytics&lt;/a&gt; (as noted in
the &lt;a href="/privacy-policy/"&gt;privacy policy&lt;/a&gt;) for visitor statistics on this
blog (more about that in a moment). So, I took a peek at the breakdown
of visitors by screen resolution, and saw that for the past year, 94% of
the 27,500 visits had a screen width of 1024px or more (and the majority
of the others looked like mobile device resolutions, so they&amp;#8217;d probably
zoom the page correctly). So, my first gut reaction was to assume that I
could use a theme approximately 1000px wide. Unfortunately, there&amp;#8217;s two
main problems with that: first, as mentioned by &lt;a href="http://css-tricks.com/screen-resolution-notequalto-browser-window/"&gt;Chris Coyier on
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CSS&lt;/span&gt;-Tricks.com&lt;/a&gt;,
just because someone has a given screen resolution doesn&amp;#8217;t mean their
browser window (let alone the viewport) is that size. As a matter of
fact, I usually have my main browser window set at about 80% of the
width of one of my monitors, with my instant messaging client
&lt;a href="http://pidgin.im/"&gt;Pidgin&lt;/a&gt; taking up the rest of the space. So there&amp;#8217;s
one inaccuracy. There&amp;#8217;s a potentially much greater inaccuracy in my
stats as well, which I&amp;#8217;m going to discuss in a &lt;a href="/2012/03/inaccuracies-in-google-analytics-for-website-stats/"&gt;separate
post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="analysis"></category><category term="analytics"></category><category term="blog"></category><category term="google"></category><category term="logging"></category><category term="stats"></category><category term="theme"></category><category term="wordpress"></category></entry></feed>
