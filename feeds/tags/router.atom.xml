my rack full of servers to a hosting provider, there&amp;#8217;s no longer a need
for me to run my &lt;a href="http://www.vyatta.org/"&gt;Vyatta &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; router on a beefy
dual-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CPU&lt;/span&gt; RAIDed &lt;a href="http://h18000.www1.hp.com/products/quickspecs/11504_na/11504_na.HTML"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DL360&lt;/span&gt;
G3&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;HP&lt;/span&gt; Proliant server chassis. I found an older PCEngines &lt;a href="http://pcengines.ch/alix2c1.htm"&gt;Alix
2c1&lt;/a&gt; single board computer (433 MHz &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AMD&lt;/span&gt;
Geode &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LX700&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="caps"&gt;128MB&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DDR&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DRAM&lt;/span&gt;, CompactFlash (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CF&lt;/span&gt;) card socket, MiniPCI, 3x
10/100 ethernet) lying around, and decided to turn that into the new
router. But I&amp;#8217;ve been so spoiled by Vyatta&amp;#8217;s good performance (well, at
least on an x86 server) and the &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CLI&lt;/span&gt;, so I don&amp;#8217;t think I can go
back to something like &lt;a href="http://m0n0.ch/wall/"&gt;m0n0wall&lt;/a&gt; or
&lt;a href="http://www.pfsense.org/"&gt;pfSense&lt;/a&gt;, and since it&amp;#8217;s going to be my only
network services box (also doing &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DNS&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DHCP&lt;/span&gt;, firewalling, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NAT&lt;/span&gt;, and maybe
IPsec &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VPN&lt;/span&gt;) it&amp;#8217;s not viable to use the type of older Cisco or Juniper
hardware that I can&amp;nbsp;afford.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The down side is that Vyatta isn&amp;#8217;t really designed or tuned for small
systems, let alone &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CF&lt;/span&gt; media that doesn&amp;#8217;t take too well to lots of
writes. So, I&amp;#8217;m going to begin experimentation with doing a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CF&lt;/span&gt; install
of the current Vyatta Core 6.3, and we&amp;#8217;ll see how it goes and what
tuning I do over&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found two relatively good references; a &lt;a href="http://www.vyatta.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=502"&gt;post on the vyatta.org
forum&lt;/a&gt; from 2008,
relating to Vyatta version 4 (also on the author&amp;#8217;s
&lt;a href="http://dataflip.blogspot.com/2008/06/optimizing-vyatta-for-compact-flash.html"&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;),
and a &lt;a href="http://peytongroup.wordpress.com/2010/02/16/vyatta-community-on-a-compact-flash/"&gt;blog
post&lt;/a&gt;
detailing a more complex
&lt;a href="http://squashfs.sourceforge.net/"&gt;SquashFS&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tmpfs"&gt;tmpfs&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href="http://unionfs.filesystems.org/"&gt;UnionFS&lt;/a&gt;
read-only Vyatta install. Given my relatively short timeframe and little
free time, I decided to try the former approach for now, and plan to
make a more customized and tuned &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CF&lt;/span&gt; version of Vyatta in the&amp;nbsp;future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Creating the actual disk&amp;nbsp;image:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My development platform at the moment is an intel-based MacBook Pro,
running MacOS X 10.6.4 and VirtualBox 4.0.12. As much of a Linux fan as
I am, my work laptop runs Mac (like everyone else in the office) and
lately I can&amp;#8217;t guarantee that I&amp;#8217;ll be at my desktop long enough to
finish anything. The target is an Alix2c1 with a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;2GB&lt;/span&gt; SanDisk Ultra &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CF&lt;/span&gt;
card (yes, I know an industrial card would be better, but I couldn&amp;#8217;t get
my hands on one). For starters, I created a new VirtualBox &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VM&lt;/span&gt; with the
following&amp;nbsp;settings:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;OS&lt;/span&gt; Type: Linux&amp;nbsp;2.6&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Base Memory:&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;128MB&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Boot Order: Floppy, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CD&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ROM&lt;/span&gt;, Hard&amp;nbsp;Disk&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;IDE&lt;/span&gt; Controller Primary: mounted vyatta-livecd_VC6.3 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISO&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;image&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;IDE&lt;/span&gt; Controller Secondary: &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RAW&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VMDK&lt;/span&gt; image (created&amp;nbsp;below)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Audio:&amp;nbsp;None&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Network: Disabled &lt;em&gt;(this is important, as Vyatta saves the
    interfaces by hardware address, and it would require some config
    editing and reboots to change&amp;nbsp;them)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Serial Port: disconnected (but&amp;nbsp;present)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One difficulty I ran into on Mac is mounting the raw &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CF&lt;/span&gt; card in the
VirtualBox guest. I plugged it in via a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USB&lt;/span&gt; reader, and of course it
automatically mounted in MacOS. I ejected it and the &lt;code&gt;/dev/disk1&lt;/code&gt; device
disappeared. It turns out that the full procedure (as far as I could
tell) for Mac&amp;nbsp;is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Plug in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CF&lt;/span&gt; card and&amp;nbsp;reader.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It should automount. Run &lt;code&gt;mount&lt;/code&gt; to see what the actual device is -
    in my case, the &lt;code&gt;/dev/disk1s1&lt;/code&gt; partition was mounted, so the disk is
    &lt;code&gt;/dev/disk1&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run &lt;code&gt;sudo umount -f /dev/disk1&lt;/code&gt;. It seems that the MacOS automounter
    has a god complex, so you may need to re-run this command quite a
    few times throughout the process if you get device or resource busy&amp;nbsp;errors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In an appropriate directory, create the raw &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VMDK&lt;/span&gt; image with:
    &lt;code&gt;VBoxManage internalcommands createrawvmdk -filename rawdisk.vmdk -rawdisk /dev/disk1&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When creating your &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VM&lt;/span&gt;, you&amp;#8217;ll have an option to select Use an
    Existing Virtual Disk. Use that option, and select the file created
    in the last&amp;nbsp;step.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once that&amp;#8217;s done, and you&amp;#8217;ve setup the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VM&lt;/span&gt; with the raw disk, boot the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VM&lt;/span&gt;
(should boot to the Vyatta LiveCD), login as usual for an install
(vyatta:vyatta), and the the fun&amp;nbsp;begins:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At the prompt after logging in, &lt;code&gt;sudo su -&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Edit &lt;code&gt;/opt/vyatta/sbin/install-system&lt;/code&gt; (hint: Vyatta has nano and vi
    installed. &lt;code&gt;nano -c filename&lt;/code&gt; shows line numbers) and change the
    &lt;code&gt;ROOT_FSTYPE&lt;/code&gt; variable (line 78 in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VC6&lt;/span&gt;.3) from &amp;#8220;ext4&amp;#8221; to&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8220;ext2&amp;#8221;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run &lt;code&gt;install-system&lt;/code&gt;. I used all default options (including one
    partition) and it seemed to work fine. It took a minute or two to
    create the ext2 filesystem on my &lt;span class="caps"&gt;2GB&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CF&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;card.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The file copy took even longer&amp;#8230; so be patient, or have a book&amp;nbsp;handy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When system-install finishes and you get the root prompt back,
    before rebooting, continue with some minor&amp;nbsp;tweaks:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;mkdir /mnt/temp&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/temp&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;cd /mnt/temp&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Edit &lt;code&gt;boot/grub/grub.cfg&lt;/code&gt; and change all occurrences of
    &amp;#8220;root=&lt;span class="caps"&gt;UUID&lt;/span&gt;=&amp;#8230;&amp;#8221; entries for the &amp;#8220;linux&amp;#8221; lines (lines 13, 18, 23, 28
    in my grub.cfg) to &amp;#8220;root=/dev/sda1&amp;#8221;. My only real reason for this
    change is so that I can move my altered config files (config.boot,
    fstab and grub.cfg) with minimal changes when I upgrade or make a
    different vyatta &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CF&lt;/span&gt; card, without having to update the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UUID&lt;/span&gt; for the
    new&amp;nbsp;partition.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Edit &lt;code&gt;etc/fstab&lt;/code&gt; and change the &amp;#8220;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;UUID&lt;/span&gt;=&amp;#8230;&amp;#8221; device to&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8221;/dev/sda1&amp;#8221;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;shutdown&lt;/code&gt;. Once the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VM&lt;/span&gt; is stopped, you can remove the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CF&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;card.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The PCEngines Alix.2 boards use a default serial console speed of
    38400 baud. Pretty much every network device, plus Linux and Vyatta,
    use a default speed of 9600 baud. Once I got the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CF&lt;/span&gt; card installed
    in the Alix board and hooked it up to my laptop (null modem cable to
    a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PL&lt;/span&gt;-2303 based &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USB&lt;/span&gt; to serial adapter, minicom for terminal
    emulation), I set my terminal emulator to 38400 8N1, powered the
    board, and then pressed &amp;#8216;s&amp;#8217; during &lt;span class="caps"&gt;POST&lt;/span&gt; to get into &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BIOS&lt;/span&gt; settings.
    Option &amp;#8216;9&amp;#8217; sets the Alix to 9600 baud, &amp;#8216;Q&amp;#8217; to quit, and &amp;#8216;Y&amp;#8217; to save
    changes permanently. The board will reboot, and once the terminal
    emulator is set back to 9600 baud, serial console should work fine
    both in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BIOS&lt;/span&gt; and in the&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;OS&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If all worked well, you should be able to boot into Vyatta and login as
the default &amp;#8220;vyatta&amp;#8221; user (which you set a password for during the
install). Assuming you know your way around Vyatta, it&amp;#8217;s pretty standard
from here, though there are a few things you may want to check or
configure right&amp;nbsp;away:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In configuration mode (&lt;code&gt;configure&lt;/code&gt;) run &lt;code&gt;show interfaces&lt;/code&gt;. All of
    your physical ethernet interfaces should appear, along with their
    &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MAC&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;addresses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some changes to reduce the number of log writes to the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CF&lt;/span&gt; card:
    &lt;code&gt;set system syslog console facility all level notice&lt;/code&gt; and
    &lt;code&gt;set system syslog global facility protocols level notice&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Configure interfaces. with firewalls, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IP&lt;/span&gt; addresses or &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DHCP&lt;/span&gt;,&amp;nbsp;etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do whatever other configuration you need for a minimal system -
    dhcp, dns, nat,&amp;nbsp;etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;#8217;s it - this should give you a working Vyatta system on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CF&lt;/span&gt; on an
Alix board. Stay tuned, hopefully in a month or so I&amp;#8217;ll get around to
customizing it a bit more, based on the second blog entry linked&amp;nbsp;above.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="alix"></category><category term="embedded"></category><category term="network"></category><category term="pcengines"></category><category term="router"></category><category term="vyatta"></category></entry><entry><title>Many Many Changes;Â Downtime</title><link href="http://blog.jasonantman.com/2009/03/many-many-changes/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2009-03-07T19:05:00-05:00</updated><author><name>admin</name></author><id>tag:blog.jasonantman.com,2009-03-07:2009/03/many-many-changes/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Well, I don&amp;#8217;t have time to go into a lot of detail, but I thought I&amp;#8217;d
give a recap of what&amp;#8217;s going on. I went down to Mount Holly, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NJ&lt;/span&gt;
yestserday morning - about a 2-/12 hour drive each way, and picked up a
41U rack for the basement. Pretty damn heavy, took me two hours to
disassemble it, wrangle it down the stairs, and get it back together.
It&amp;#8217;s an old round-hole rack, which didn&amp;#8217;t seem to matter much until I
found that the tabs of the Dell Rapid Rails are just a bit too big to
fit in it, so neither my rack &lt;span class="caps"&gt;KMM&lt;/span&gt; nor the rails for my mail server will
fit. A bigger problem, though, is that the guy told me it was the
standard &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HP&lt;/span&gt; 29&amp;#8221; deep, and I found it to be 28-1/4&amp;#8221; deep when I started
racking things up. So, though I just spent $200 on rails for old
Proliants, they&amp;#8217;re all about 1/2&amp;#8221; too long to&amp;nbsp;fit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, I also had Cablevision show up to install the new Optimum
Business with 5 static&amp;nbsp;IPs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, last night around 9:00, I started the arduous task of (for the first
time ever) powering down &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ALL&lt;/span&gt; of my machines, moving them to the new
rack, and re-cabling. That took about 2-1/2 hours, after which my intent
was to bring up the new Optimum connection, configure the Vyatta router,
and roll over mail and web. From what I&amp;#8217;d read of the Vyatta docs it
seemed a relatively straightforward task, and being the stubborn jackass
that I am, I decied, &amp;#8220;hey, it&amp;#8217;s my personal site, it&amp;#8217;s low traffic, and
I want it up before I go to sleep. I&amp;#8217;ll roll over &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DNS&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; I bring
everything&amp;nbsp;up.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was a &lt;strong&gt;very bad idea&lt;/strong&gt;. Vyatta isn&amp;#8217;t nearly as
simple as it seems - especially for someone who isn&amp;#8217;t really a network
(or at least router/firewall) guy. When they say Enterprise, they mean
robust. They also mean that week-long bootcamps aren&amp;#8217;t for naught. It
took me about half an hour to figure out that even if no &amp;#8220;firewall&amp;#8221;
ruleset is associated with an interface, it still has an implicit drop
all. And if you only want to firewall what&amp;#8217;s coming in from the outside
world, and let everything out, you need to add explicit allow all rules
to the in and out sides of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LAN&lt;/span&gt; inteface and the out side of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WAN&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To top all this off, I had some serious still-unexplained &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DHCP&lt;/span&gt; problems
on the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LAN&lt;/span&gt;, a serious issue since I just set all my hosts to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DHCP&lt;/span&gt; (which
I&amp;#8217;ll probably undo soon). So, Yesterday was network work from 7:30 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AM&lt;/span&gt; to
3 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AM&lt;/span&gt; today (including driving to pickup the rack). By the time 3 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AM&lt;/span&gt;
rolled around, I was quite unhappy that I decided to roll over &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DNS&lt;/span&gt; in
order to force myself to get things working, as I ended up going back to
FiOS for client access only. Today started around 10 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AM&lt;/span&gt;, and here I am -
6:30 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PM&lt;/span&gt;, and I just got things working partially right. I have mail
working - arguably the most important - for jasonantman.com only, though
I have yet to setup any&amp;nbsp;aliases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the web side, I&amp;#8217;m working to setup name-based vhosts for all of the
subdomains, but for some reason, blog is showing up for everything.
Luckily it works right. So we&amp;#8217;ll&amp;nbsp;see&amp;#8230;.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="firewall"></category><category term="optimum"></category><category term="rack"></category><category term="router"></category><category term="wan"></category></entry><entry><title>Vyatta InitialÂ Impressions</title><link href="http://blog.jasonantman.com/2009/02/vyatta-initial-impressions/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2009-02-26T10:06:00-05:00</updated><author><name>admin</name></author><id>tag:blog.jasonantman.com,2009-02-26:2009/02/vyatta-initial-impressions/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m part-way through the major overhaul of my home network (hosting this
blog and everything else jasonantman.com) that I&amp;#8217;ve been planning for
quite some time. The current hardware is&amp;#8230; uh&amp;#8230; currently&amp;#8230; described
on my Hardware
page, but I soon plan on ditching the wiki and moving to a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CMS&lt;/span&gt; for my
entire&amp;nbsp;site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, so far I&amp;#8217;ve decommissioned my aged &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HP&lt;/span&gt; ProCurve 2424M switch
and replaced it with used but less-aged Cisco 2948G from &lt;a href="http://horizondatacom.com/"&gt;Horizon
Datacom&lt;/a&gt; (purchased on Ebay). Quite an
upgrade. In order to handle network backups a little better, I&amp;#8217;m also
adding a Cisco 4912G 12-port Gigabit (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GBIC&lt;/span&gt;) aggregation switch for the
administrative/backup &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VLAN&lt;/span&gt; - though this was purchased via ebay from
&lt;a href="http://stores.ebay.com/RedApe-Technologies"&gt;RedApe Technologies&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PA&lt;/span&gt;.
The switch came with 12 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;1000BASE&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SX&lt;/span&gt; GBICs, and I plan to do a mix of
copper (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;1000BASE&lt;/span&gt;-T) where it&amp;#8217;s already available (onboard NICs) and
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;1000BASE&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SX&lt;/span&gt; where there&amp;#8217;s enough room in the box for a&amp;nbsp;card.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the hardware side, I also have 2 new boxes - a set of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HP&lt;/span&gt; Proliant
&lt;a href="http://h18000.www1.hp.com/products/quickspecs/11049_na/11049_na.HTML"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DL360&lt;/span&gt;
G2&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8216;s
from &lt;a href="http://www.mjsglobal.com/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;MJS&lt;/span&gt; Global&lt;/a&gt;, who I&amp;#8217;ve done business
with before. The prices were great, and though one of them showed up
with a faulty temperature sensor that prevents boot, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MJS&lt;/span&gt; has been
wonderful and is shipping me a replacement motherboard. One of the boxes
will be running &lt;a href="http://www.vyatta.org/"&gt;Vyatta&lt;/a&gt; (vee-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AH&lt;/span&gt;-tha) &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VC5&lt;/span&gt;
router/firewall software, and the other will be a new services box
running internal &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DNS&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DHCP&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NTP&lt;/span&gt;, and whatever&amp;nbsp;else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the hardware side, I&amp;#8217;m also planning some extended downtime a few
weekends from now, when I should finally have a 42U rack to replace the
Sears shelves my equipment is now on. It&amp;#8217;ll be a fun-filled evening of
racking equipment and re-patching everything. Also, hopefully within a
few weeks, I&amp;#8217;ll be moving my &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WAN&lt;/span&gt; pipe from Verizon FiOS residential to
Optimum Business, which is essentially re-packaged residential but
provides 5 static IPs, no blocked ports, and 30 Mbps down/5 Mbps&amp;nbsp;up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vyatta&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When planning this upgrade, I think I looked at every open source router
package out there, as well as some of the lower-end or older Cisco
models. I&amp;#8217;m currently running &lt;a href="http://www.ipcop.org/"&gt;IPcop&lt;/a&gt;, which does
everything I need except it doesn&amp;#8217;t handle multiple &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WAN&lt;/span&gt; IPs, and all
configuration is via a web interface - which means every time I want to
make a change remotely (and during the week I&amp;#8217;m not home) I have to
forward &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTTPS&lt;/span&gt; over &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SSH&lt;/span&gt;. After doing an extensive feature comparison, I
ended up narrowing it down to a relative newcomer - Vyatta. Though I
don&amp;#8217;t know how much of it is marketing hype, they are targeted squarely
at Cisco, and provide relatively enterprise-level features; a
JunOS-based &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CLI&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BGP&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OSPF&lt;/span&gt;, and all of the other important&amp;nbsp;stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I attempted an install of Vyatta &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CE&lt;/span&gt; 5 Beta on one of the
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DL360G2&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s. The only real problem that I found was the install script
doesn&amp;#8217;t support &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CCISS&lt;/span&gt; drives, as found in the Proliants, but a few
manual hacks to the script fixed that. By far the best thing about
Vyatta is it&amp;#8217;s based on vanilla Debian Lenny, and full root shell access
is available, so modifying the install script - or even adding
non-Vyatta packages - is a cinch. I haven&amp;#8217;t really played around with it
too much, but it appears to be a wonderful mix of Linux and an
enterprise router &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CLI&lt;/span&gt;. While root has a full &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BASH&lt;/span&gt; shell, and the Vyata
commands are all done as shell aliases (so users still have access to
shell primitives and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OS&lt;/span&gt; commands), configuration is accomplished via a
JunOS-like command set. You still get &amp;#8220;commit&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;rollback&amp;#8221; in config
mode, and can still do fun things like save and load configs to/from
tftp, ftp and &lt;em&gt;http&lt;/em&gt;. On the other hand, I doubt I&amp;#8217;ll do config backups
that way since I can just use scp or&amp;nbsp;sftp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Vyatta box will probably go home this weekend, and get hooked up to
the network for config-only use (and I can always get in via iLO on the
hardware) and hopefully come up sometime in the next few&amp;nbsp;weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, the most daunting task is figuring out how to get all of
the existing links to my site to work - since jantman.dyndns.org will be
legacy, and most of the site structure will probably change to use
name-based vhosts. Lately I&amp;#8217;ve been trying to use the real subdomains in
all of my public links, so the transition (planned for a while) will
work, but I&amp;#8217;m sure there are still plenty of links out there that will
need dealing with (maybe keep port 10011 serving &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTTP&lt;/span&gt; with a massive
mod_rewrite script to redirect to the right place???), as well as
checking everything on the web server to make sure there aren&amp;#8217;t any
absolute URLs (like&amp;nbsp;WordPress).&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="cisco"></category><category term="networking"></category><category term="router"></category><category term="vyatta"></category></entry></feed>
