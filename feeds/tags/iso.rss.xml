tribulations&lt;/a&gt;.
This really is starting to get disgusting. It&amp;#8217;s not that I hate
Microsoft, I don&amp;#8217;t. What I hate is their attitude, and their business
practices. Everyone else - I mean &lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt; - makes software that
interoperates with other vendors. Microsoft, even after a &lt;em&gt;billion&lt;/em&gt;
dollar fine, won&amp;#8217;t. Everyone else uses open, industry-accepted
standards. Microsoft doesn&amp;#8217;t. Many other vendors open up their code.
Microsoft tried to make some vague gesture to, but makes it incompatible
with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPL&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;d code (okay, okay, I know about &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ZFS&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8230;) and says developers
can only use it in non-commercial projects. So they open a few things up
to hobbyists, and want a pat on the back. It boils down to how they
treat customers and developers. Not very well. I don&amp;#8217;t like that. I&amp;#8217;m
not going to start on the technical aspects of Windows, though it seems
to be getting better, a baby step at a time. But the bottom line is that
Microsoft actively tries to turn the software industry into a facist
dictatorship, where you do it Microsoft&amp;#8217;s way, or you&amp;#8217;re taken out back
and shot (ok, bought up and then shut&amp;nbsp;down).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, from the blog of Zeheda Bhorat, Open Source Programs Manager at&amp;nbsp;Google,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google believes &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OOXML&lt;/span&gt; would be an insufficient and unnecessary
standard, designed purely around the needs of Microsoft&amp;nbsp;Office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can it be that the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISO&lt;/span&gt; - the International
Organization for &lt;em&gt;Standardization&lt;/em&gt; - would
actually consider a &lt;em&gt;second&lt;/em&gt;,
competing standard for document formats. And one that&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href="http://www.noooxml.org/argu-brief"&gt;as flawed as
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;OOXML&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;? These guys are the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISO&lt;/span&gt;. They
practically run the world, at least technically. Why don&amp;#8217;t they have the
balls to look Microsoft in the eye and say, &amp;#8220;Hey, moron. We already
&lt;strong&gt;have&lt;/strong&gt; a document format
standard. It&amp;#8217;s called &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISO&lt;/span&gt; 26300. If you want to have anything to do with
the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISO&lt;/span&gt;, which sets &lt;em&gt;standards&lt;/em&gt;,
you can take your 6,000 page specification, put it through a crosscut
paper-burning radiation-producing shredder, pay the $320 for a copy of
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISO26300&lt;/span&gt;, and implement&amp;nbsp;it!&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">admin</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 27 Feb 2008 14:05:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>tag:newblog.jasonantman.com,2008-02-27:2008/02/microsoft-again/</guid><category>iso</category><category>microsoft</category><category>ooxml</category></item></channel></rss>
