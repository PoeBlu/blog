Quite an&amp;nbsp;ordeal.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I just finally finished my migration from self-hosted WordPress to &lt;a href="http://getpelican.com"&gt;Pelican&lt;/a&gt;, a Python-based
static site generator, hosted on &lt;a href="http://pages.github.com/"&gt;GitHub Pages&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;#8217;s not only easier and free, but also the
first step in my plan to migrate off of my &lt;a href="http://linode.com"&gt;Linode&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VM&lt;/span&gt; and onto a mix of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EC2&lt;/span&gt; and free&amp;nbsp;services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m sure this post will be &lt;a href="/2009/02/wordpress-installation-finished/"&gt;around in five years&lt;/a&gt; when there&amp;#8217;s a smarter way
to do all this, but until then&amp;#8230;&amp;nbsp;yay!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hit a number of bumps during the migration, mainly around &lt;a href="/2014/02/converting-wordpress-posts-to-pelican-markdown/"&gt;Migrating &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt; posts from WordPress to Markdown in Pelican&lt;/a&gt;
and migrating &lt;a href="/2014/03/wordpress-to-pelican-with-disqus-comments/"&gt;WordPress comments to Disqus&lt;/a&gt;, but in the end everything
seems to be working. Hopefully someone will find this and save a few hours or days of work if they try the same&amp;nbsp;thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Post-go-live I still had some issues - Disqus was displaying an&amp;nbsp;error:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were unable to load Disqus. If you are a moderator please see our troubleshooting&amp;nbsp;guide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;on all posts created after the WordPress migration, and FeedBurner rejected my attempts to change the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RSS&lt;/span&gt; feed &lt;span class="caps"&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt; to
its new value (though I&amp;#8217;m pretty sure that&amp;#8217;s because I neglected to drop the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TTL&lt;/span&gt; on the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DNS&lt;/span&gt; record, and I can&amp;#8217;t
find a way to tell Feedburner to purge it from&amp;nbsp;cache).&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="blog"></category><category term="wordpress"></category><category term="pelican"></category><category term="github"></category></entry><entry><title>Wordpress to Pelican with Disqus comments</title><link href="http://blog.jasonantman.com/2014/03/wordpress-to-pelican-with-disqus-comments/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2014-03-01T09:09:00-05:00</published><updated>2014-03-01T09:09:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Jason Antman</name></author><id>tag:blog.jasonantman.com,2014-03-01:/2014/03/wordpress-to-pelican-with-disqus-comments/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Solutions to some of the many problems converting a WordPress blog to a Pelican blog with Disqus for&amp;nbsp;commenting.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is the second part of my WordPress to &lt;a href="http://getpelican.com"&gt;Pelican&lt;/a&gt; conversion saga.
In the &lt;a href="/2014/03/converting-wordpress-posts-to-pelican-markdown/"&gt;last post&lt;/a&gt; I ran through some
of the issues that I faced when converting the posts themselves, setting up my theme and settings,
etc. In this post, I&amp;#8217;ll discuss the saga of moving from WordPress comments to Disqus&amp;nbsp;comments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be sure to read &lt;strong&gt;all&lt;/strong&gt; of this before trying it yourself, as I had some serious problems with my
first&amp;nbsp;attempt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="initial-import-to-disqus"&gt;Initial Import to&amp;nbsp;Disqus&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially, I installed the Disqus WordPress plugin as instructed in
&lt;a href="http://help.disqus.com/customer/portal/articles/466255-importing-comments-from-wordpress"&gt;Disqus&amp;#8217; Import from WordPress documentation&lt;/a&gt;.
The automatic import imported three of 134 comments, and froze there,
even though the status said it was 100% complete. I emailed Disqus&amp;#8217; support,
and was told that this meant the import failed (even though there was no explicit
notification, their admin &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UI&lt;/span&gt; said the import was successful) and I had to manually
import my comments. I did this, as instructed in the same docs, by disabling all
plugins except for Disqus and generating an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;XML&lt;/span&gt; export from WordPress, then re-enabling
the plugins, and uploading the export to Disqus. This time, I ended up with all 134
comments in Disqus, so I assumed that all went&amp;nbsp;well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="previewing-comments-in-pelican"&gt;Previewing Comments in&amp;nbsp;Pelican&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I added my Disqus &lt;code&gt;shortname&lt;/code&gt; to the &lt;code&gt;DISQUS_SITENAME&lt;/code&gt; field in &lt;code&gt;pelicanconf.py&lt;/code&gt; and
re-built. I ended up having an issue with &lt;code&gt;SITE_URL&lt;/code&gt; being set incorrectly for some testing
that I did, so that killed 10 minutes. I rebuilt locally with &lt;code&gt;SITE_URL&lt;/code&gt; not defined, and
then used &lt;code&gt;fab serve&lt;/code&gt; to serve locally. I was using my
&lt;a href="/2014/01/planning-migration-from-wordpress-to-static-site/"&gt;Planning Migration from Wordpress to Static Site&lt;/a&gt;
post to test, as it was both the most recent post, and had a five comments in WordPress, which imported
correctly into Disqus and were visible both in the Disqus moderation tool and on the now-Disqus-powered
WordPress&amp;nbsp;blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I rebuilt with &lt;code&gt;DISQUS_SITENAME&lt;/code&gt; set and served locally with SimpleHTTPServer (&lt;code&gt;fab serve&lt;/code&gt;),
I checked the post and saw only a &amp;#8220;We were unable to load Disqus&amp;#8221; message below the post. It contained
a &lt;a href="http://help.disqus.com/customer/portal/articles/472007-i-m-receiving-the-message-%22we-were-unable-to-load-disqus-%22"&gt;link to their help article for that problem&lt;/a&gt;,
which pointed me at a domain mismatch/different origin problem. As indicated on that page,
I went to Settings -&amp;gt; Advanced in the Disqus admin, found the &amp;#8220;Trusted Domains&amp;#8221; box, and added
both my test domain (newblog.jasonantman.com - pointing at GitHub pages until I was ready to
shut WordPress down and actually move the live site) and &amp;#8220;localhost&amp;#8221; for testing, and&amp;nbsp;saved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I refreshed the page I was looking at, and now could see the Disqus commenting below my post,
but it wasn&amp;#8217;t showing any of the comments&amp;nbsp;yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Disqus commenting with no comments" src="/GFX/disqus_wrong_url.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I pulled up the source of the page, and saw in the Disqus javascript just below the post&amp;nbsp;content:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;            &lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;disqus_shortname&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;jasonantman&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// required: replace example with your forum shortname&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;disqus_identifier&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;planning-migration-from-wordpress-to-static-site&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;disqus_url&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;../../../2014/01/planning-migration-from-wordpress-to-static-site/&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Everything looked &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt; to me except for &lt;code&gt;disqus_url&lt;/code&gt;, which I&amp;#8217;d seen mention of on the
&lt;a href="http://help.disqus.com/customer/portal/articles/472007-i-m-receiving-the-message-%22we-were-unable-to-load-disqus-%22"&gt;help page&lt;/a&gt;
I&amp;#8217;d just been looking at. Sure enough, it indicated that the &lt;code&gt;disqus_url&lt;/code&gt; var must be
an absolute &lt;span class="caps"&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt; to the post, not a relative path. I assume this was because I&amp;#8217;d generated
the content without having &lt;code&gt;SITE_URL&lt;/code&gt; set, so I hand-edited the generated page to change this
to the correct &lt;span class="caps"&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt;, http://blog.jasonantman.com/2014/01/planning-migration-from-wordpress-to-static-site/,
and tested again. Unfortunately, still zero&amp;nbsp;comments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="wordpress-disqus-plugin-permalinks"&gt;WordPress Disqus Plugin&amp;nbsp;Permalinks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fearing the worst, I pulled up the same post on my now-Disqus-powered WordPress blog,
and took a peek at the source. The javascript over there revealed a&amp;nbsp;problem:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;disqus_url&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;http://blog.jasonantman.com/2014/01/planning-migration-from-wordpress-to-static-site/&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;disqus_identifier&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;1546 http://blog.jasonantman.com/?p=1546&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;disqus_container_id&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;disqus_thread&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;disqus_domain&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;disqus.com&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;disqus_shortname&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;jasonantman&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;disqus_title&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Planning Migration from WordPress to Static Site&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;While the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt; is correct, the Disqus WordPress plugin uses the WordPress
post &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ID&lt;/span&gt; and permalink for the &amp;#8220;identifier&amp;#8221;, but the Pelican plugin uses the slug.
That&amp;#8217;s a problem, as my Pelican site will have the same URLs, but the WordPress
post-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ID&lt;/span&gt;-based permalinks are gone (since it&amp;#8217;s a static site, and there&amp;#8217;s no easy
way of replicating things that are query param based). The WordPress post IDs
are thrown out by Pelican, so there&amp;#8217;s no way to connect the&amp;nbsp;two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even worse, I remembered that Disqus&amp;#8217;
&lt;a href="http://help.disqus.com/customer/portal/articles/466255-importing-comments-from-wordpress"&gt;Importing Comments from WordPress help page&lt;/a&gt;
clearly&amp;nbsp;stated:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imported comments can&amp;#8217;t be permanently deleted. Consider following our &lt;a href="http://help.disqus.com/customer/portal/articles/1053796-best-practices-for-staging-development-and-preview-sites"&gt;guidelines for development sites&lt;/a&gt; to make sure the data you&amp;#8217;re importing is correct. You can &lt;a href="http://disqus.com/register"&gt;register a new forum&lt;/a&gt; if you have imported the wrong&amp;nbsp;comments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id="solution-to-permalink-issue"&gt;Solution to Permalink&amp;nbsp;Issue&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not seeing any way around it, I figured it was time to &amp;#8220;bite the bullet&amp;#8221;. I disabled the Disqus plugin
in WordPress and then installed and activated the
&lt;a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/code-freeze/"&gt;WordPress Code Freeze Plugin&lt;/a&gt;
to disable comments. (&lt;em&gt;Note&lt;/em&gt; ironically, this plugin also uses JavaScript to disable your ability to
deactivate plugins, including itself. So before you activate it, copy the &amp;#8220;Activate&amp;#8221; link and save it
somewhere; changing &lt;code&gt;action=activate&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;action=deactivate&lt;/code&gt; will let you get rid of it if you&amp;nbsp;want).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disqus has some documentation on &lt;a href="http://help.disqus.com/customer/portal/articles/1104797-importing-exporting"&gt;Importing and Exporting&lt;/a&gt;
which includes &lt;a href="http://help.disqus.com/customer/portal/articles/472150"&gt;Custom &lt;span class="caps"&gt;XML&lt;/span&gt; Imports&lt;/a&gt; based on the
WordPress &lt;span class="caps"&gt;XML&lt;/span&gt; export format. So, I figured that I just had to decide that WordPress commenting would be
turned off, and do a point-in-time migration to Disqus (maybe circling back to hack the Disqus &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WP&lt;/span&gt; plugin
to keep comments working there for the time&amp;nbsp;being).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before anything else, I decided to actually set up a test forum/site in Disqus like they suggested.
I updated the &lt;code&gt;DISQUS_SITENAME&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;pelicanconf.py&lt;/code&gt;, and then started in on the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;XML&lt;/span&gt; munging. The
&lt;a href="http://help.disqus.com/customer/portal/articles/472150"&gt;Custom &lt;span class="caps"&gt;XML&lt;/span&gt; Imports&lt;/a&gt; documentation implies
that the import engine recognizes a &lt;code&gt;dsq:thread_identifier&lt;/code&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;XML&lt;/span&gt; element that holds the thread identifier,
but that element wasn&amp;#8217;t present in my WordPress &lt;span class="caps"&gt;XML&lt;/span&gt; export. It appeared that Disqus was concatenating the
&lt;code&gt;wp:post_id&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;guid&lt;/code&gt; fields (with a space in between) to come up with the&amp;nbsp;identifier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I wrote a script (&lt;a href="https://github.com/jantman/blog/blob/master/dev/wp-move/wp_comment_xml_munge.py"&gt;wp_comment_xml_munge.py&lt;/a&gt;)
using &lt;a href="http://lxml.de/"&gt;lxml&lt;/a&gt; that adds the &lt;code&gt;dsq:&lt;/code&gt; namespace to the WordPress &lt;span class="caps"&gt;XML&lt;/span&gt; export (unfortunately using
string replacement and a temp file, due to a &lt;a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/lxml/+bug/555602"&gt;bug in lxml&lt;/a&gt;)
and then adds the &lt;code&gt;dsq:thread_identifier&lt;/code&gt; tag to each post item, setting its value to the same
string as &lt;code&gt;wp:post_name&lt;/code&gt;, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt; slug (and post identifier in&amp;nbsp;Pelican).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I imported the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;XML&lt;/span&gt; written by the script into my test forum in Disqus and rebuilt the Pelican content.
Magically, the first time I looked, the comments were&amp;nbsp;there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, time to see if I could get the same effect with the existing Disqus&amp;nbsp;site/forum:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the Disqus moderation interface, delete all comments. You&amp;#8217;ll have to do this in batches of 10, as that&amp;#8217;s
   how they&amp;#8217;re paged in the interface. The comments don&amp;#8217;t seem to be permanently deleted, but do show as&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8220;deleted&amp;#8221;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go to &lt;a href="http://import.disqus.com"&gt;import.disqus.com&lt;/a&gt; and select your &amp;#8220;forum&amp;#8221; (site). You should see your existing
   (previous) import, as 100% complete, with the correct count of threads and comments. Do another import with the
   &lt;code&gt;_disqus.xml&lt;/code&gt; munged &lt;span class="caps"&gt;XML&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;export.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Comments should now be linked to the correct post in&amp;nbsp;Pelican.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, Pelican seemed to be working, but WordPress was still left with only the old internal commenting,
and that was disabled by the Code Freeze plugin. I probably could have manually patched the Disqus plugin to
reflect the new thread identifiers, but instead, I chose to just push forward with the switch from WordPress to&amp;nbsp;Pelican.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That only took a few hours, and I&amp;#8217;m happy to say that I&amp;#8217;m now up and running with a Pelican blog, hosted for free
by GitHub&amp;nbsp;Pages.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="wordpress"></category><category term="pelican"></category><category term="blog"></category><category term="disqus"></category><category term="comments"></category></entry><entry><title>Converting WordPress Posts to Pelican MarkDown</title><link href="http://blog.jasonantman.com/2014/02/converting-wordpress-posts-to-pelican-markdown/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2014-02-28T22:21:00-05:00</published><updated>2014-02-28T22:21:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Jason Antman</name></author><id>tag:blog.jasonantman.com,2014-02-28:/2014/02/converting-wordpress-posts-to-pelican-markdown/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;My adventures converting my WordPress blog to Pelican, the problems I encountered, and how I solved&amp;nbsp;them.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago, I
&lt;a href="/2014/01/planning-migration-from-wordpress-to-static-site/"&gt;posted&lt;/a&gt; about my
plans to convert my self-hosted WordPress blog to a static site using a static
blog generator. Since then, I&amp;#8217;ve decided to stop working on my exhaustive
&lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AnHh-ye5DNiNdF9DWkJrT2kzSkNsNVp6cjMzLXJ6VEE&amp;amp;usp=sharing"&gt;static blog generator comparison spreadsheet&lt;/a&gt;
and just try &lt;a href="http://getpelican.com"&gt;Pelican&lt;/a&gt; - mainly because it&amp;#8217;s written in
Python which is my current strongest language, comes highly recommended, seems
to have most of the features I want, and seems to be easily&amp;nbsp;extensible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I walked through the documentation for the latest version (3.3.0), started
a &lt;a href="https://github.com/jantman/blog"&gt;GitHub repo&lt;/a&gt;, and tweaked a bunch of
settings. The repo is public, so if you want to take a look behind the scenes,
see my &lt;a href="https://github.com/jantman/blog/blob/master/fabfile.py"&gt;fabfile&lt;/a&gt;,
etc. feel&amp;nbsp;free. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="initial-wordpress-import-attempt"&gt;Initial WordPress Import&amp;nbsp;Attempt&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used the WordPress &lt;span class="caps"&gt;XML&lt;/span&gt; Export tool, as instructed in the &lt;a href="http://docs.getpelican.com/en/latest/importer.html"&gt;Pelican Importer documentation&lt;/a&gt;.
At first, I attempted to do a more-or-less default import from WordPress using
the &lt;code&gt;pelican-import&lt;/code&gt; tool, which writes rST, and then build the blog. What I
ended up with was thousands of errors complaining about &amp;#8220;Inline interpreted
text or phrase reference start-string without end-string&amp;#8221;, &amp;#8220;Explicit markup
ends without a blank line; unexpected uninden&amp;#8221;, &amp;#8220;malformed hyperlink target&amp;#8221;,
&amp;#8220;Unknown target name&amp;#8221; on all of my links, and a bevy of other Docutils
errors. It was so utterly awful that I gave&amp;nbsp;up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="wordpress-import-as-markdown"&gt;WordPress Import as&amp;nbsp;MarkDown&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next I tried importing as MarkDown instead of rST,&amp;nbsp;using:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;pelican-import --markup markdown --wpfile -o content/ --dir-page jasonantman039sblog.wordpress.2014-01-11.xml
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;That built without errors, and the posts looked somewhat right out of the
box, without any of the previous thousands of errors. And the links looked
mostly right - even the captions for images. Though I&amp;#8217;m working at a Python
shop and writing a lot of Python these days, my knowledge of MarkDown is still
much better than rST, so this is fine for me. (I even wrote a &lt;code&gt;fab post&lt;/code&gt; task
that prompts for a title, generates all of the post metadata, writes it to the
right file, and opens up an editor on&amp;nbsp;it.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first problem was that the import script gave me one &amp;#8220;content&amp;#8221; directory
with 346 &amp;#8220;.md&amp;#8221; files in it - not exactly easy to work with. Luckily the
metadata was right, so a quick little
&lt;a href="https://github.com/jantman/blog/blob/master/move_wordpress.sh"&gt;bash script&lt;/a&gt;
moved the posts into a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;YYYY&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;MM&lt;/span&gt; directory&amp;nbsp;hierarchy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="obvious-problems-with-imported-posts"&gt;Obvious Problems with Imported&amp;nbsp;Posts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After getting the MarkDown import working, and the posts moved to the proper
paths, I was still having some&amp;nbsp;issues&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="syntax-hilighting-gone"&gt;Syntax Hilighting&amp;nbsp;Gone&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In WordPress, I was using the
&lt;a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-syntax/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;WP&lt;/span&gt;-Syntax&lt;/a&gt; plugin to perform
syntax hilighting via &lt;a href="http://qbnz.com/highlighter/"&gt;GeSHi&lt;/a&gt;. The plugin uses
pre tags with a &lt;code&gt;lang=&lt;/code&gt; attribute to specify the language,&amp;nbsp;like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;lt;pre lang=&amp;quot;bash&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, these translated to some really ugly MarkDown fenced blocks&amp;nbsp;like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;~~~~ {lang=&amp;quot;bash&amp;quot;}
cp /boot/efi/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;EFI&lt;/span&gt;/fedora/grub.cfg /boot/efi/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;EFI&lt;/span&gt;/fedora/grub.cfg.bak
echo &amp;#39;GRUB_DISABLE_OS_PROBER=&amp;quot;true&amp;quot;&amp;#39; &amp;gt;&amp;gt; /etc/default/grub
grub2-mkconfig &amp;gt; /boot/efi/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;EFI&lt;/span&gt;/fedora/grub.cfg
~~~~
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;that seem to be just a bit off from what MarkDown/Pygments can handle. The
places where I just used bare &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;pre&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; blocks translated&amp;nbsp;fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;http://blog.gastove.com/2013-09-17_enabling_line_numbers_for_pygments.html&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fixed this by using fenced blocks with the &amp;#8216;lang=&amp;#8217; stuff removed, and in class
syntax like the MarkDown docs suggest. Some four-tab-indents with
:::identifier&amp;nbsp;work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="broken-links"&gt;Broken&amp;nbsp;Links&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems that something in the conversion process introduced line wraps (could
it really be Pandoc itself???) Unfortunately, this wreaks havoc with any
explicit reference links
that use long (long enough to break across lines) titles, depending on where
they are in the line. It seems that in some places they end up breaking
differently in the link in the text and in the link definition, which MarkDown misses, and
then renders broken links and plain text of the link table at the bottom of
the page. Manually removing the line breaks and any extraneous spaces seems to
fix&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, yes, Pandoc was doing this because of the &lt;code&gt;--reference-links&lt;/code&gt; parameter
that &lt;code&gt;pelican-import&lt;/code&gt; was calling it with. There was an
&lt;a href="https://github.com/getpelican/pelican/issues/348"&gt;issue&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href="https://github.com/getpelican/pelican/pull/642"&gt;pull request&lt;/a&gt; to fix this,
but when I started with Pelican the last release was 3.3.0 (4 months ago) and
the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PR&lt;/span&gt; was merged after that. So, if you&amp;#8217;re having the same problem and the
latest release of Pelican is still 3.3.0, you might as well just apply
&lt;a href="https://github.com/getpelican/pelican/commit/83e4d35b44a422ee8d4b077f505970d03e555f45"&gt;the patch&lt;/a&gt;
yourself - it&amp;#8217;s just a very simple removal of a parameter in
&lt;code&gt;pelican_import.py&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="overall-results"&gt;Overall&amp;nbsp;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m quite happy with the overall results. I also spent a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of time manually fixing
markup issues that didn&amp;#8217;t translate well through Pandoc, but I suppose that&amp;#8217;s to be
expected given that many of my older blog posts had &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;issues.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="pelican"></category><category term="wordpress"></category><category term="blog"></category><category term="markdown"></category></entry><entry><title>Planning Migration from WordPress to Static Site</title><link href="http://blog.jasonantman.com/2014/01/planning-migration-from-wordpress-to-static-site/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2014-01-01T15:15:00-05:00</published><updated>2014-01-01T15:15:00-05:00</updated><author><name>admin</name></author><id>tag:blog.jasonantman.com,2014-01-01:/2014/01/planning-migration-from-wordpress-to-static-site/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Right now, this blog, my email, and a whole bunch of other services are

honestly, I&amp;#8217;d rather spend my time working on other things (like
actually writing all of the blog posts that I&amp;#8217;ve been planning to. The
first thing I&amp;#8217;ve identified for migration is this blog itself. It&amp;#8217;s
currently on WordPress and, frankly, I don&amp;#8217;t either need nor like it.
But there are some features I like. I&amp;#8217;d like to end up with a static
site generator, hosted from either S3 or GitHub Pages. I know that means
I&amp;#8217;ll lost comments (unless I move to a third-party, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JS&lt;/span&gt;-based comment
system like &lt;a href="http://disqus.com/"&gt;Disqus&lt;/a&gt;, which means I&amp;#8217;ll lose
&lt;em&gt;control&lt;/em&gt; over my comments) but I suppose I can live with that. What I
really want is something simple, static, cheap or free (that I&amp;#8217;ll likely
put behind a small ec2 instance running nginx for&amp;nbsp;redirects/rewrites).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m still in the planning phase, and trying to come up with a
feature-by-feature comparison of my options. I&amp;#8217;ll likely post that when
I finally have it done (at the moment it&amp;#8217;s in a very rough &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AnHh-ye5DNiNdF9DWkJrT2kzSkNsNVp6cjMzLXJ6VEE&amp;amp;usp=sharing"&gt;Google Docs
spreadsheet&lt;/a&gt;).
I&amp;#8217;m trying to round up my static site generator options and see which
ones will do most, if not all, of what I want (though I still haven&amp;#8217;t
discounted using hosted wordpress if it comes down to it). Here are the
features I currently &amp;#8220;use&amp;#8221; (have) on my WordPress&amp;nbsp;blog:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;User-defined permalinks to&amp;nbsp;posts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Overall &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RSS&lt;/span&gt; feed of blog (currently powered by FeedBurner) and of&amp;nbsp;comments)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Categories (a post can be in multiple&amp;nbsp;categories)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tags&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Category and Tag&amp;nbsp;pages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;per-Category and per-Tag feeds&amp;nbsp;(&lt;span class="caps"&gt;RSS&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tag cloud &amp;#8220;widget&amp;#8221; in&amp;nbsp;sidebar&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Themes. I actually like my current &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WP&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;theme&amp;#8230;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Visitor statistics (currently self-hosted
    &lt;a href="http://piwik.org/"&gt;Piwik&lt;/a&gt;, formerly Google&amp;nbsp;Analytics)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Post publishing via cron&amp;#8217;ed script (&lt;em&gt;see below&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Draft/Pending status (i.e. let me save a partial post, and let me
    save a complete post but mark it &amp;#8220;pending&amp;#8221; so I can just publish it&amp;nbsp;later)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Commenting (this will probably be the big sticking&amp;nbsp;point)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Syntax&amp;nbsp;hilighting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As &amp;#8220;weird&amp;#8221; as this is, I write all my posts in raw &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt;, and am
    perfectly happy doing&amp;nbsp;that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Subscribe via Email&amp;#8221; FeedBurner&amp;nbsp;widget&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;XML&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;Sitemap&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Twitter&amp;nbsp;box/widget&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pingbacks (not that these are really useful for anything other than
    spam these&amp;nbsp;days)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Automatic or manual post excerpts for feeds,&amp;nbsp;etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remote publishing via &lt;span class="caps"&gt;XML&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;RPC&lt;/span&gt;/Android app (not that I&amp;#8217;ve used it
    more than once or&amp;nbsp;twice)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Advertising - I currently use Google AdSense on my blog. The revenue
    from my tiny hit count isn&amp;#8217;t enough to offset the cost of a Linode,
    but if I moved to a much less expensive hosting service, it might be
    worth considering (you can&amp;#8217;t run ads on the free hosted WordPress,
    and I doubt you can on GitHub Pages&amp;nbsp;either).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should be updating this post when I do some more research and have a
comparison of the&amp;nbsp;options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note on &amp;#8220;Post publishing via cron&amp;#8217;ed script&amp;#8221; - sometimes I sit down and
write half a dozen or so blog posts at a time. But I don&amp;#8217;t want them all
to show up immediately, and spam the few people who still use &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RSS&lt;/span&gt;
readers after the death of Google Reader. So I set the posts to
&amp;#8220;Pending&amp;#8221; status, and I have a cron&amp;#8217;ed script that runs every weekday
morning and publishes the one oldest &amp;#8220;pending&amp;#8221; post. Who knows if this
actually does any good or&amp;nbsp;not&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="blog"></category><category term="jekyll"></category><category term="pelican"></category><category term="python"></category><category term="static site"></category><category term="wordpress"></category></entry><entry><title>Piwik Web Analytics, and some unfortunate stats about my blog</title><link href="http://blog.jasonantman.com/2012/08/piwik-web-analytics-and-some-unfortunate-stats-about-my-blog/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2012-08-26T13:18:00-04:00</published><updated>2012-08-26T13:18:00-04:00</updated><author><name>admin</name></author><id>tag:blog.jasonantman.com,2012-08-26:/2012/08/piwik-web-analytics-and-some-unfortunate-stats-about-my-blog/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Back in March when I selected a new template for this blog, I

&lt;a href="/2012/03/new-blog-theme/"&gt;posted&lt;/a&gt; that I was looking into open source
self-hosted web analytics tools to replace &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/"&gt;Google
Analytics&lt;/a&gt;. There were a few reasons
for this; most importantly, it started from a discussion with some
privacy-conscious coworkers, who said that they use
&lt;a href="http://noscript.net/"&gt;NoScript&lt;/a&gt; and specifically block Google from
tracking them (which also breaks Google Analytics). This was a serious
issue for me, as I no longer process server-side logs but relied solely
on Google Analytics for traffic information. So, I decided to try
something other than Google and ended up settling on
&lt;a href="http://piwik.org/"&gt;Piwik&lt;/a&gt; as my solution. I will say, in full
disclosure, that the amount of information Piwki gives is a bit scary; I
can watch users navigate this blog in realtime, and even the initial
dashboard page gives a list of the most recent visitors, with their &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IP&lt;/span&gt;
address, country of origin, browser, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OS&lt;/span&gt;, and the pages they visited.
However my decision was made on two main points: first, that I wanted
something withich could use server-side &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt; to log visits (albeit with a
lot less information) of people who had JavaScript or tracking disabled,
and second, that if &lt;em&gt;someone&lt;/em&gt; is going to have such amazingly detailed
information on my visitors, it should be me, so I can ensure that I&amp;#8217;m
the only person who has access to it and that it isn&amp;#8217;t used for the
wrong&amp;nbsp;purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside: The only revenue I get from this site is through &lt;a href=""&gt;Google
AdSense&lt;/a&gt;, which isn&amp;#8217;t a whole lot given the low traffic (certainly
not enough to pay for the hosting). Other than that, I keep this blog
to try and share my knowledge with others, and hope that someone else
can find the solution to their problem here instead of doing the work
that I did. So, I find analytics very helpful; I check my stats now
and then, go back and update or add to the most popular posts, and try
to write relevant posts if it seems like a lot of people are finding
their way here for something slightly different than the actual post
they landed on. Unfortunately, that last point isn&amp;#8217;t as easy since
&lt;a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2011/10/making-search-more-secure.html"&gt;Google switched to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTTPS&lt;/span&gt; Search for logged-in users on October 18th,
2011&lt;/a&gt;
- I can no longer use Piwik see the search keywords that got Google
users to my site. Luckily, these are still available through &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/"&gt;Google
Webmaster Tools&lt;/a&gt; (via
Traffic -&gt; Search Queries on the left menu), though it adds an
additional step and removes some of my motivation to check regularly
and make sure people are getting useful content. Also, perhaps most
importantly, it doesn&amp;#8217;t let me associate search query with other stats
like time on page, so even if one search query was very popular, I
have no way of knowing whether all those people actually read the
page, or took one look at it and&amp;nbsp;left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really like Piwki. I don&amp;#8217;t use most of it terribly often, but it gives
me a nice overview visits graph on the WordPress dashboard (via the
&lt;a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-piwik/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;WP&lt;/span&gt;-Piwik&lt;/a&gt; plugin),
infinitely detailed information (most of which I haven&amp;#8217;t even looked at)
in the Piwki web interface, and nightly email reports of visits to the
site. It also supports multiple sites, so I have it on my ancient
&lt;a href="http://wiki.jasonantman.com"&gt;wiki&lt;/a&gt;, my
&lt;a href="http://redmine.jasonantman.com"&gt;Redmine&lt;/a&gt; instance, and even
&lt;a href="/2012/03/adding-piwik-web-analytics-integration-to-viewvc/"&gt;ViewVC&lt;/a&gt;.
I&amp;#8217;d highly recommend it; it&amp;#8217;s full-featured (beyond anything I can even
comprehend,&amp;nbsp;really)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was recently looking through the stats for this blog, and came by some
unfortunate, though not surprising, trends. Below is the graph of visits
per day, from April 1, 2012 through today (August 26,&amp;nbsp;2012):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="blog visits chart" src="/GFX/blog_visits.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;#8217;s probably not terribly unusual for a site with as much technical
    content as mine (and mostly professional stuff, not just for
    hobbyists), my weekend traffic is usually a full 50% lower than
    weekday traffic. This can also be seen in the graph of visits by
    visitor&amp;#8217;s local time, which is decidedly biased towards the 9am-5pm
    window:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;img alt="blog visits chart by visitor local
    time" src="/GFX/blog_visits_localtime.png"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    I guess there&amp;#8217;s nothing I can really do about that, and it just
    gives me a nice maintenance window at 4am on Sunday mornings&amp;nbsp;:)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Looking at the overall graph, there also appears to be quite a bit
    of oscillation of the average visits over time. It&amp;#8217;s nothing
    terribly large, but at a guess, I&amp;#8217;d attribute it to my sporadic&amp;nbsp;posting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Though it&amp;#8217;s not visible in these graphs, this site has an 80% bounce
    rate (the percent of visitors that viewed only one page and then
    left the site). I guess that&amp;#8217;s also not terribly unusual for a site
    with mostly how-to information on a wide variety of&amp;nbsp;topics.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To add a little more information to some of the previous items, here
    is the chart of my &lt;a href="http://feedburner.google.com"&gt;Feedburner&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RSS&lt;/span&gt;/Atom feed, since I started using Feedburner in February. The
    number of subscribers is in green, and the reach (number of people
    who actually clicked through to a post) is in blue:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;img alt="Feedburner stats" src="/GFX/feedburner_stats.png"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    This is a clear indication of something even stronger than the
    &amp;#8220;bounce rate&amp;#8221;; the apparently high number of people who subscribe to
    and then unsubscribe from my feed (if these stats are accurate). To
    me, this is an even stronger indication that what I really need to
    do is post useful content on a more regular basis - I have a
    tendency to blog in spurts, and either start a draft and never
    finish it, or write a few posts and set them to &amp;#8220;pending&amp;#8221; status
    with the intent of publishing them over a few days&amp;#8230; and then
    forget the last&amp;nbsp;part.&lt;/li&gt;

lots of widget support and hooks, something that has good visual
separation between different posts and widgets. I also really want
something, if possible, with relative column widths. My current home and
work desktops both have dual monitors, and the minimum resolution I have
on one screen is 1920x1080. When I look at my blog in a maximized
window, about half the screen width is wasted with empty space. So,
ideally, I&amp;#8217;d like a theme that&amp;#8217;s based on relative widths, probably with
a &amp;#8220;min-width&amp;#8221; property so it wouldn&amp;#8217;t get compressed to an absurdly
narrow width on small&amp;nbsp;screens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/"&gt;Google Analytics&lt;/a&gt; (as noted in
the &lt;a href="/privacy-policy/"&gt;privacy policy&lt;/a&gt;) for visitor statistics on this
blog (more about that in a moment). So, I took a peek at the breakdown
of visitors by screen resolution, and saw that for the past year, 94% of
the 27,500 visits had a screen width of 1024px or more (and the majority
of the others looked like mobile device resolutions, so they&amp;#8217;d probably
zoom the page correctly). So, my first gut reaction was to assume that I
could use a theme approximately 1000px wide. Unfortunately, there&amp;#8217;s two
main problems with that: first, as mentioned by &lt;a href="http://css-tricks.com/screen-resolution-notequalto-browser-window/"&gt;Chris Coyier on
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CSS&lt;/span&gt;-Tricks.com&lt;/a&gt;,
just because someone has a given screen resolution doesn&amp;#8217;t mean their
browser window (let alone the viewport) is that size. As a matter of
fact, I usually have my main browser window set at about 80% of the
width of one of my monitors, with my instant messaging client
&lt;a href="http://pidgin.im/"&gt;Pidgin&lt;/a&gt; taking up the rest of the space. So there&amp;#8217;s
one inaccuracy. There&amp;#8217;s a potentially much greater inaccuracy in my
stats as well, which I&amp;#8217;m going to discuss in a &lt;a href="/2012/03/inaccuracies-in-google-analytics-for-website-stats/"&gt;separate

Not to mention, it doesn&amp;#8217;t allow any of the stuff that I really want,
such as multiple categories with per-category &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RSS&lt;/span&gt;, or good searching. It
also means that, though this blog is hosted on my own server, I&amp;#8217;m
dependent on Blogger to add&amp;nbsp;posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m still horribly busy dealing with insurance companies and the police
in relation to my stolen truck, as well as looking around and trying to
figure out what my next vehicle will be, and how much I can spend on&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I&amp;#8217;ve decided that at some point in the future, I&amp;#8217;ll be migrating
to &lt;a href="http://www.wordpress.org"&gt;WordPress&lt;/a&gt; for the blog. It will, of
course, be hosted on my own machine, and will hopefully also include a
migration of everything from this Blogger account. And, somehow, will
include some sort of redirection from old posts to the relevant new
ones. Most importantly, though, I plan on deferring the project until I
get my multiple static &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IP&lt;/span&gt; service from &lt;a href="http://www.optimum.com"&gt;Optimum
Online&lt;/a&gt;, as the new blog (and the rest of my
subdomains) will be moved from GoDaddy forwarding to their own
subdomains setup as Apache name-based&amp;nbsp;VHosts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After some serious grepping through the source, and adding &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt; comments
to see where they appeared, I finally found a solution to add the button
to the MediaWiki sidebar - though I&amp;#8217;d really like it to appear below the
search box (I guess that&amp;#8217;s something for my to-do list). I&amp;#8217;m using the
MonoBook skin (though somewhat modified). I&amp;#8217;m using &amp;#8220;MonoBook nouveau&amp;#8221;,
and it should be the version that shipped with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MW&lt;/span&gt; 1.10.1. In this
version, I added the code around line 166. Specifically, this was added
before the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;div id="p-search" class="portlet"&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; line, and after the end
of the &lt;code&gt;foreach ($this-&amp;gt;data['sidebar'] as $bar =&amp;gt; $cont)&lt;/code&gt; loop. This
threw the button in a box directly above the search box, and below all
of my sidebar&amp;nbsp;links.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code looked something&amp;nbsp;like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;?php } ?&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other news, I&amp;#8217;m taking a Data Driven Websites class this summer
(&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt;/MySQL, but for some reason they switched to a Windows server&amp;#8230;
endless problems, and I can&amp;#8217;t even edit with Nano on the server, let
alone emacs). Our first project was to build a blog engine, which I&amp;#8217;m
working on right now. Anyway, it got me thinking&amp;#8230; the one thing that
Blogger is missing is the ability to post to a given category, and allow
users to view or subscribe to a specific category (or everything). So I
think I may look into writing something like that myself, if I can&amp;#8217;t
find a good alternative that&amp;#8217;s already done and is F/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;OSS&lt;/span&gt;. Regardless,
I&amp;#8217;ll probably be keeping the Blogger template as well as (ugh) moving
over all of my current posts, which Blogger chose to store in raw &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt;.
So there&amp;#8217;s going to be a lot of parsing on my&amp;nbsp;future&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PS&lt;/span&gt; - When I get a new blog engine, I&amp;#8217;m also going to go for a slightly
modified template that uses relative widths and placement - so that
code, like the snippet here, fits the screen&amp;nbsp;correctly.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="blog"></category><category term="firefox"></category><category term="mediawiki"></category><category term="PHP"></category></entry><entry><title>Website, Blog, Bacula</title><link href="http://blog.jasonantman.com/2007/10/website-blog-bacula/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2007-10-10T13:35:00-04:00</published><updated>2007-10-10T13:35:00-04:00</updated><author><name>admin</name></author><id>tag:blog.jasonantman.com,2007-10-10:/2007/10/website-blog-bacula/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Website&lt;/strong&gt; - In personal news, I&amp;#8217;ve finished migrating all of the

getting some kinks ironed out, and working on customization, but it
seems to be coming along very well. It&amp;#8217;s wonderfully easy to update
information and to link between articles. Most of the content is more
like notes than articles, but I&amp;#8217;m trying to put most of my SysAdmin and
programming notes up there, both for my own future reference and that of
anyone who happens by the site. As always, though, some content will
just live its&amp;#8217; life as a blog entry, so I encourage searching of my blog
as well. This is my fourth instance of MeidaWiki, and while I haven&amp;#8217;t
set them up to play together, they all run wonderfully - and share a lot
of common configuration (though I have separate instances of the code).
Hopefully I&amp;#8217;ll do a bunch of reorganization of the wiki sometime, and
keep adding new content. Some of the newer pages include pages on
&lt;a href="http://www.jasonantman.com/wiki/index.php/DenyHosts"&gt;DenyHosts&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href="http://www.jasonantman.com/wiki/index.php/Hpasm"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;HPASM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (from my blog&amp;nbsp;post).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blog&lt;/strong&gt; - I know the template is awful. It&amp;#8217;s on my list of things to
do, and should be at the top of the queue in approximately&amp;nbsp;2056.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bacula&lt;/strong&gt; - Up to now, my backups have been a total kludge. The mere
explanation of this elicits a feeling of nausea. A shell script on my
backup storage server executes via cron. Each of the four important
servers on my network (mail, web, monitoring, and development) have
shell scripts that handle local backups - tar&amp;#8217;ing up a list of
directories, MySQL dumps, etc. - then tar gzip the whole thing and plop
it in a local directory. The backup server executes these scripts and
then copies the temporary files to its own disk via &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SCP&lt;/span&gt;. All of this is
handled through an &lt;a href="http://expect.nist.gov/"&gt;expect&lt;/a&gt; script, that runs
each server consecutively. By morning, I end up with a 6+ hour job
that&amp;#8217;s finished, and dumped gigs of files on the backup server. Before
finishing each machine, it deletes any backups on the backup server that
are older than 10 days. After copying everything, it deletes the
client&amp;#8217;s local copy. The bottom line is that if a machine goes down, I
can re-install the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OS&lt;/span&gt; and all packages, and then have the backups of
just /etc and user data. Not beautiful. Even worse, my backup storage
server doesn&amp;#8217;t have a tape drive. When I get around to it, I run a
script on my development/storage box that copies the latest backups from
each machine, located on the backup server, to a tempdir and then writes
them to tape. To top it all off, I have only one network, so all of
these gigs of data are crawling across my ancient 10/100 switch, along
with all other connectivity to the outside&amp;nbsp;world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, it doesn&amp;#8217;t look like I&amp;#8217;ll have the money to upgrade to
Gig-E any time soon, even just for the 5 machines involved. More to the
point, there&amp;#8217;s no way that I&amp;#8217;ll have the money to buy a manageable Gig-E
switch that can come anywhere close to my &lt;a href="http://www.jasonantman.com/wiki/index.php/BayStack_450-24T"&gt;BayStack
450-24T&lt;/a&gt;.
So, it&amp;#8217;s time to invest&amp;#8230; well&amp;#8230; time&amp;#8230; in a good backup
infrastructure. After doing a lot of research, I came to two&amp;nbsp;findings:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The two main options seem to be &lt;a href="http://www.amanda.org/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AMANDA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and
    &lt;a href="http://www.bacula.org/"&gt;Bacula&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t like how &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AMANDA&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;works.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I&amp;#8217;m going to give Bacula a shot. I did consult the
&lt;a href="http://www.sage.org/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SAGE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; mailing list for advice, and got some
recommendations for &lt;a href="http://backuppc.sourceforge.net/"&gt;BackupPC&lt;/a&gt;, but
Bacula seems to be more my type of thing. Well, I did an install, and
spent about 8 hours hacking around with the config files. No luck.
Bacula is designed to be highly modular and scalable, but to be honest,
I find the config files to be *very* complicated. Furthermore, I
wasn&amp;#8217;t able to find any good example configurations with documentation.
After brainstorming for a while (laying in bed watching Law &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Order and
reading the Bacula docs on dead trees) I decided to give in - despite my
continued efforts to stop using it, I checked
&lt;a href="http://www.webmin.com"&gt;Webmin&lt;/a&gt; and, surely enough, they have a Bacula
module. After starting with fresh config files, I was able to get Bacula
up and running on my development/storage server (a fresh install of
openSuSE 10.1) as the director. I got a file daemon installed on the web
server. Everything looked&amp;nbsp;wonderful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current status: My backup storage server does only that - storage of
backups. Nothing else. It&amp;#8217;s still running SuSE 9.3. The Bacula RPMs for
9.3 are from the 1.x tree, and all of my other machines are running
openSuSE 10.x, with Bacula 2.x. I gave it a shot but, sure enough, a
Bacula 2.x director won&amp;#8217;t jive with a 1.x storage daemon. And I&amp;#8217;m in
dependency hell - Bacula 2.x requires upgrades of everything from the C
libs all the way up. So, I&amp;#8217;m going to give a shot at an upgrade of the
storage machine via YaST, and see where I&amp;nbsp;get.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="bacula"></category><category term="blog"></category><category term="jasonantman"></category><category term="mediawiki"></category><category term="wiki"></category></entry></feed>
