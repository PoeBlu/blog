Things are quite busy, with work 4
days a week (9-5) and classes 6-9:30 at night 4 days a week (though
classes are Mon-Thurs and work is&amp;nbsp;Tues-Fri).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m plodding along on with &lt;a href="http://www.tuxtruck.org/"&gt;TuxTruc&lt;/a&gt;k - we now
have a domain name
(&lt;a href="http://www.tuxtruck.org/"&gt;http://www.tuxtruck.org/&lt;/a&gt;) and playlist
generation is finished. This weekend should yield playlist parsing. Once
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;MP3&lt;/span&gt; playing is working, I&amp;#8217;ll begin the hardcore development - &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPS&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OBD&lt;/span&gt;,
and Bluetooth. Also, I&amp;#8217;m working on a hardware budget for the prototype,
but it&amp;#8217;s ending up much higher than originally imagined. If I end up
going with the &lt;a href="http://www.xenarc.com/product/MDT-X7000.html"&gt;Xenarc
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;MDT&lt;/span&gt;-X7000&lt;/a&gt; display (which
includes a head unit with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DVD&lt;/span&gt; playing, amplifier, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CD&lt;/span&gt; playing, and radio
- though those are features I&amp;#8217;d rather to in software on the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PC&lt;/span&gt;, and
just use the amplifier) which runs $800 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USD&lt;/span&gt;, the total is looking more
like $2000 than the $1000 I had planned. More to the point, the X7000
currently has poor reviews, and is backordered everywhere pending a
firmware revision. I may end up going the route of a separate head unit,
or a dedicated amplifier (though volume control is still an issue) and
getting a better daylight-readable touchscreen (though I still have a
strong preference for a motorized in-dash type, given the theft rate
around&amp;nbsp;school).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another item of news - my mother is considering moving from Verizon FiOS
to the Cablevision/Optimum Triple Play - iO digital &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TV&lt;/span&gt;, cable, and
voice. Given that jasonantman.com - and all of my other machines - live
on shelves in her basement, this will have quite an impact on me. And a
good one! Optimum offers Business-grade service at 30 Mbps down/5 Mbps
up &lt;strong&gt;with 5 static IPs&lt;/strong&gt; at a rate
that I can afford. So, there may be an end to DynDNS, and my sites might
finally live on port 80, like they should! On the down side, this would
mean (for digital &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TV&lt;/span&gt;) a major coax rewiring of mom&amp;#8217;s house - and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RG&lt;/span&gt;-6/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;UQ&lt;/span&gt;
isn&amp;#8217;t&amp;nbsp;cheap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the tip of the day - OpenOffice Calc formula to increase the
last quad of an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IP&lt;/span&gt; address by&amp;nbsp;one:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;=CONCATENATE(LEFT(A1;SEARCH(".[0-9]+$";A1));VALUE(RIGHT(A1;LEN(A1)-SEARCH(".[0-9]+$";A1)))+1)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was doing up a little spreadsheet of IPs in the office, and like a
good &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SA&lt;/span&gt; (with nothing else to do), came up with a formula to increase
the last octet by one. Just enter a dotted-quad &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IP&lt;/span&gt; in A1 (or whatever
other cell, correcting the formula), paste this below it, and copy down
the page to your heart&amp;#8217;s content. (Granted, it only changes the last
octet, and expects a properly formatted&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;IP&lt;/span&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="ip address"></category><category term="openoffice"></category><category term="spreadsheet"></category><category term="tuxtruck"></category></entry></feed>
