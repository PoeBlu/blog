&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve been using Linux for five years. I&amp;#8217;m in the process of planning to
move a lot of my servers and development systems to the openSolaris
operating system. Overall, I&amp;#8217;m a pretty technical person. While I admit
to occasionally using &lt;a href="http://www.webmin.com"&gt;Webmin&lt;/a&gt;, I&amp;#8217;m perfectly
comfortable editing the Apache config files by hand. That being said,
with all of the recent emphasis on Linux as a desktop machine (for end
users!) there are some things that I expect to &amp;#8220;just work&amp;#8221;. When I
upgraded for openSuSE 10.2, and now 10.&lt;span class="caps"&gt;3RC1&lt;/span&gt;, I expected some good
desktop technology - granted, openSuSE isn&amp;#8217;t the choice for a &amp;#8220;just
works&amp;#8221; end-user&amp;nbsp;desktop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One word. &lt;strong&gt;Printing.&lt;/strong&gt; Despite how I&amp;#8217;ve tried, I still can&amp;#8217;t get my
Linux boxen to print well. Printing a webpage from Firefox requires
endless tweaking of borders, margins, and other nasty stuff. If I happen
to be in a new location and print something, I grab a pen, as I know
that the headers and footer/last few lines of text on my web page will
be cut off, unless I&amp;#8217;ve tweaked the margins for the specific&amp;nbsp;printer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is this the case? Of all the things that people want Linux to do,
this seems like a simple one. The printable area of an 8 1/2x11&amp;#8221; piece
of paper is relatively standard. The actual printable margins for a
given printer are well known. So why is it the my &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HP&lt;/span&gt; LaserJet or my
roommate&amp;#8217;s Brother &lt;span class="caps"&gt;5500DN&lt;/span&gt; is such a mystery to&amp;nbsp;Linux?&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="linux suse printing"></category></entry></feed>
