But first, a small&amp;nbsp;aside:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I drive a &lt;a href="http://www.jasonantman.com/wiki/index.php/Image:TruckMed.jpg"&gt;Ford
F-250&lt;/a&gt;.
It&amp;#8217;s a pretty big truck. And every once in a while, someone cuts me
off in something like a &lt;a href="http://automobiles.honda.com/fit/"&gt;Honda
Fit&lt;/a&gt;. It really makes me stop and
wonder - how stupid are they? I&amp;#8217;ll admit that after two and a half
years of driving a 13,000 pound
&lt;a href="http://www.midlandparkambulance.com/albums/The%20New%20588.php"&gt;ambulance&lt;/a&gt;
in my spare time, I know a bit about the maneuverability problems of
large vehicles. But I have to assume that the average driver, when
confronted with something like my truck - 6500 pounds empty, 21 feet
long and tall enough that the hood is at the level of the roof of most
passenger cars - they&amp;#8217;d think twice about doing something stupid. I
won&amp;#8217;t even mention the people who cut off or tailgate dump trucks and&amp;nbsp;semi&amp;#8217;s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve spent a bit of time on the water throughout my life. Piloting a
boat isn&amp;#8217;t especially difficult, but there are a few things you learn
about navigation. One of them is affectionately known as &lt;a href="http://www.auxguidanceskills.info/press/bigger.html"&gt;The Law of
Gross Tonnage&lt;/a&gt;.
It&amp;#8217;s really simple. Big things take a long time to stop, and can&amp;#8217;t
maneuver very well. So stay out of their way. So I have to wonder, why
don&amp;#8217;t they include this in driver&amp;#8217;s manuals? Sure, people do stupid
things. Some people just have to, it&amp;#8217;s part of their nature. But if
they&amp;#8217;re going to, why can&amp;#8217;t they be smart, and choose to do it in
front (or behind) of a vehicle that actually has a chance of&amp;nbsp;stopping?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other news, I&amp;#8217;m starting to shop for a new switch. At the moment, my
network at home (hosting this blog/site and everything else) is running
on a single, ancient, Rutgers University surplus &lt;a href="http://www.jasonantman.com/wiki/index.php/BayStack_450-24T"&gt;Bay Networks BaySTack
450-24T&lt;/a&gt;.
It&amp;#8217;s served me well (and it server Rutgers well before me) but it&amp;#8217;s time
for an upgrade. While it&amp;#8217;s a manageable switch, it&amp;#8217;s only capable of
100Base-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TX&lt;/span&gt;. And streaming a few gigs of backups over it every night
isn&amp;#8217;t fun, not to mention attempting a network install of a full&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;OS&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, it&amp;#8217;s time to shop for a new switch. Depending on budget, I&amp;#8217;ve
identified two possible&amp;nbsp;configurations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get a new 10/100 manageable switch for the main network, and buy a
    desktop 8- to 12-port Gigabit Ethernet switch for a dedicated backup&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;LAN&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bite the bullet and buy a Gigabit manageable&amp;nbsp;switch.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If possible, I&amp;#8217;m leaning towards the second option. My budget puts me in
the market for what are normally considered edge switches, and Gigabit
is just arriving in that land (heck, the dictionary in my browser
doesn&amp;#8217;t even know it&amp;#8217;s a word). The bottom line is that it&amp;#8217;s going to be
a long time before anything faster than Gigabit makes it to most
desktops. So, I&amp;#8217;m distinctly aware of the possibility of needing a
manageable switch and eventually implementing 802.1ad link aggregation
to increase bandwidth to the backup server and other key&amp;nbsp;machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The major features I&amp;#8217;m interested&amp;nbsp;in:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;19&amp;#8221; rack mount form factor, at least 16 ports (24 would be good) all
    at Gigabit&amp;nbsp;speeds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Something from a good manufacturer, not a white-box or house brand.
    Good&amp;nbsp;support.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extensive manageability - at a minimum, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SNMP&lt;/span&gt; and Telnet. Hopefully&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;RMON&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;802.1Q&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;VLANS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Good options for firmware upgrades, and not anything that requires a
    service contract (i.e.&amp;nbsp;Cisco).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;802.3ad Link Aggregation (at a minimum, supporting 3 systems with
    2-4 links&amp;nbsp;each).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Port&amp;nbsp;mirroring.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Support for QoS/CoS - at a minimum,&amp;nbsp;802.1p.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Acceptable&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;MTBF&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some added bonuses that I&amp;#8217;d really&amp;nbsp;like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Support for syslog to a separate&amp;nbsp;machine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SFP&lt;/span&gt; slots so I can move to a faster backbone switch in the future,
    or move key systems to fiber or a faster&amp;nbsp;standard.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even more management - &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SSH&lt;/span&gt; would be nice, as would &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RADIUS&lt;/span&gt; or &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TATACS&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;authentication.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A good switch fabric capacity - 32Gbps or higher for a&amp;nbsp;24-port.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;802.3af Power over Ethernet. (Well, I could always use&amp;nbsp;injectors)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;MAC&lt;/span&gt; filtering, ACLs, and/or 802.1x&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NAC&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;802.1ab&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;LLDP&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ll keep looking around and pricing things out. My hard budget is $500,
but it would take a lot to get me to spend that much. I&amp;#8217;m probably
looking for something closer to the $300 range, probably lightly used or
refurbished. If anyone happens to see this and has a suggestion, feel
free to&amp;nbsp;share!&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">admin</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 02 Apr 2008 16:25:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:newblog.jasonantman.com,2008-04-02:2008/04/switch-shopping-the-law-of-gross-tonnage/</guid><category>driving</category><category>gigabit</category><category>switch</category></item></channel></rss>
