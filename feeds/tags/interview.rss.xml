company (I won&amp;#8217;t say who, but they&amp;#8217;re a household name, growing fast,
and doing cool things; that doesn&amp;#8217;t leave &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; many options). I rarely
remember to write down interview questions, but I was cleaning out my
desk this morning and came by a ripped-out sheet of notebook paper with
a handful of the interview questions written on it. Most of them weren&amp;#8217;t
terribly difficult, or terribly unusual for competent technical
interviewers, but since I happen to actually have the list written down,
I though I&amp;#8217;d share it. I don&amp;#8217;t remember why the programming questions
are all Python; likely, I was asked to choose between Python (which I&amp;#8217;ve
used, though not lately), Ruby (which I can barely muddle my way through
reading on a good day), and something else I don&amp;#8217;t know. Here are some
of&amp;nbsp;them&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is an inode? What does it&amp;nbsp;store?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is a hard&amp;nbsp;link?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is the difference between a hard link and a soft&amp;nbsp;link?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is a list in&amp;nbsp;Python?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Name some data structures that you&amp;#8217;d use in Python. Describe them,
    and tell me why you would use&amp;nbsp;them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How would you list all the man pages containing the keyword&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8220;date&amp;#8221;?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the &lt;code&gt;chmod&lt;/code&gt; binary had its permissions set to &lt;code&gt;000&lt;/code&gt;, how would
    you fix&amp;nbsp;it?&lt;/li&gt;
