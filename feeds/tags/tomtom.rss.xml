about the recent Microsoft lawsuit against TomTom, alleging patent
infringement. Coverage has been extensive, including
&lt;a href="http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20090226070041454"&gt;GrokLaw&lt;/a&gt;
and &lt;a href="http://www.linux-mag.com/id/7258"&gt;Linux Magazine&lt;/a&gt;. While the
mentioned patents include car navigation technology (at least the names
of the patents seem amazingly vague) and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FAT&lt;/span&gt; . Most of the news stories
I&amp;#8217;ve read say that it&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;good for Linux&amp;#8221; and will never see the inside
of a&amp;nbsp;courtroom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe I&amp;#8217;m just a pessimist, but I see the idea behind this as much worse
than &amp;#8220;good for Linux&amp;#8221;. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MS&lt;/span&gt; chose one company to sue. TomTom just happens
to be not only a household name, but also posted a $1.2 Billion loss
last year. It seems to me this is more of a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FUD&lt;/span&gt; campaign than anything
else&amp;#8230; the best case for Microsoft is that they could strangle TomTom
in a legal battle, perhaps force them to go under, and then ensure a
media spin along the lines of &amp;#8220;Know that company that made the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPS&lt;/span&gt; in
every car? They used Linux in it, they got sued by Microsoft, and
they&amp;#8217;re no&amp;nbsp;more.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I haven&amp;#8217;t always been a fan of TomTom - and am still bothered by
the fact that my (stolen, no longer in my possession) TomTom One ran
Linux but wouldn&amp;#8217;t give me a console or even let me see the filesystem -
I&amp;#8217;ll be watching this closely, and hoping that the powers that be will
not let the angry dinosaur crush a company over a series of patents that
are either horribly obvious (anyone other than Garmin having a claim to
any &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPS&lt;/span&gt;-related idea is beyond me) or just horrible&amp;nbsp;(&lt;span class="caps"&gt;FAT&lt;/span&gt;?!?!?!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a final note - isn&amp;#8217;t it about time that the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; finally dealt with
this damn software patent thing? Not only does it horribly stifle
innovation (not good to do in a bad economy), and I have a hard time
grasping the claim that Microsoft&amp;#8217;s developers are so all-powerful that
they&amp;#8217;re the only people that thought of technology X, but it&amp;#8217;s about
time that the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; government got the balls to look Microsoft in the eyes
and say, &amp;#8220;you&amp;#8217;re not the only game in town anymore. Get used to&amp;nbsp;it.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">admin</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 05 Mar 2009 10:05:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>tag:newblog.jasonantman.com,2009-03-05:2009/03/my-take-on-the-ms-tomtom-suit/</guid><category>lawsuit</category><category>microsoft</category><category>patents</category><category>tomtom</category></item></channel></rss>
