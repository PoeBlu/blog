about how much work I do outside of &amp;#8220;work hours&amp;#8221;. And the answer is, I don&amp;#8217;t really know, especially when it comes to
projects that I really enjoy and find interesting. So, I decided to have some fun with &lt;a href="https://github.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython"&gt;GitPython&lt;/a&gt;
and find&amp;nbsp;out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result of this was &lt;a href="https://github.com/jantman/misc-scripts/blob/master/whendoiwork.py"&gt;whendoiwork.py&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;#8217;s a pretty simple script,
and also makes some pretty big assumptions, but I found the results interesting. Given some local directories which contain git clones
of my work repositories, and some which contain clones of my personal repos, it iterates over all* of the commits in them by me
(going by the git author name) in the last N days (default 365); it counts commits to personal repositories as +1 and to work
repositories as -1, and adds them to buckets per hour of day, per day of week. It then uses &lt;a href="http://matplotlib.org/"&gt;matplotlib&lt;/a&gt;
to build a heatmap, with the maximum commits per hour for work repos in blue and the maximum per hour for personal in&amp;nbsp;red.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#8217;t vouch that it&amp;#8217;s 100% accurate, but the results were interesting to me; while it seems like I tend to do a fair amount
of work in the evenings, compared to work on personal projects, all of my work for my employer is well contained in my normal
7-3 work&amp;nbsp;day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s an example of the output of this script, for my own work, run&amp;nbsp;with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;./whendoiwork.py -v -a /home/jantman/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GIT&lt;/span&gt; -b /home/jantman/work/git -b /home/jantman/work/git/ops -d 365 -t &amp;#39;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt;/Eastern&amp;#39; --repoAlabel personal --repoBlabel work
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Note that this iterates over every commit in all of the git repos it finds, possibly multiple times. On my own
system (9G of git repos with a few hundred thousand commits), this took about 2&amp;nbsp;minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
