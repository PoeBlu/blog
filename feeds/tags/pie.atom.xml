All in all I&amp;#8217;ve been liking it aside from a few differences in the last four years of Android development that annoy me. By far the biggest issue I&amp;#8217;ve had was my alarm clock not going off two morings, and going off seventeen minutes late another morning. At first I thought maybe I was shutting my alarm off, but that doesn&amp;#8217;t seem likely&amp;#8230; I use &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.vp.alarmClockPlusDock"&gt;Alarm Clock Plus&lt;/a&gt;, and have been using it for almost ten years, because it allows me to set an alarm that requires correctly solving some algebra to snooze or dismiss it. I tend to be a very heavy sleeper, and the &amp;#8220;math to snooze&amp;#8221; / &amp;#8220;math to dismiss&amp;#8221; requirement ensures that I actually wake up, yet eliminates the harsh &amp;#8220;alarm clock on the other side of the room&amp;#8221;&amp;nbsp;solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I was right, I didn&amp;#8217;t suddenly start sleeping so deeply that I could do the algebra and disable my alarm without even remembering it. On the third day of no alarm, I saw the pattern: if I had my phone on the charger, the alarm went off. If my phone wasn&amp;#8217;t on the charger overnight - as I&amp;#8217;d started doing because I now had a phone that lasted &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; days on a charge - the alarm wouldn&amp;#8217;t go off. I figured it had to be something with power management or putting apps to&amp;nbsp;sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure enough, this was caused by the new &amp;#8220;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AI&lt;/span&gt;-based&amp;#8221; battery optimization, which by default limits background usage - not just data, but processor cycles - of apps that it thinks you don&amp;#8217;t use&amp;nbsp;often.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To solve this on my Samsung Galaxy S10 running Android 9 / OneUI&amp;nbsp;1.1:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open the Android Settings&amp;nbsp;app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scroll to and tap on&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8220;Apps&amp;#8221;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tap on the app in question (Alarm Clock Plus for&amp;nbsp;me).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tap on &amp;#8220;Battery&amp;#8221; in the &amp;#8220;Usage&amp;#8221;&amp;nbsp;menu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ensure the &amp;#8220;Allow background activity&amp;#8221; slider is&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ON&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tap the &amp;#8220;Optimize battery usage&amp;#8221;&amp;nbsp;button.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Near the top left, change the dropdown from &amp;#8220;Apps not optimized&amp;#8221; to&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8220;All&amp;#8221;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find the app in question, and tap it to turn the slider&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;OFF&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This should let the app use background resources as it desires, such as ensuring that your alarm goes off when&amp;nbsp;scheduled.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="android"></category><category term="samsung"></category><category term="s10"></category><category term="galaxy s10"></category><category term="android 9"></category><category term="pie"></category><category term="battery optimization"></category><category term="app"></category></entry></feed>
