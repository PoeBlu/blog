blog&lt;/a&gt; as Campus Ambassador for Rutgers
University. Not that I honestly think anyone reads the non-technical
blog entries here, but if you do, you may want to check out the Sun blog
as&amp;nbsp;well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the Sun blog entries will probably have to do with Sun
technologies in education or at Rutgers, but when there is something of
interest to a more general audience, I&amp;#8217;ll be sure to post here as&amp;nbsp;well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other news, I&amp;#8217;m really really busy lately, between Sun training, my
job (now doing hardware/lab support and some wireless work) for Rutgers,
and school. I have a really long list of things to do personally,
including buying some new systems to move my home/development network
over to the Solaris 10 operating system, getting a new template for this
blog, and wikifying all of my web sites (mostly those at
&lt;a href="http://www.jasonantman.com"&gt;jasonantman.com&lt;/a&gt;). To top it all off, my
truck was broken into this afternoon (broad daylight on a busy street)
while I was at class. The front passenger window was smashed in and my
Mio c310x &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPS&lt;/span&gt; was stolen, so between the window and the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPS&lt;/span&gt;, I&amp;#8217;m a bit
behind where I&amp;#8217;d like to be in terms of&amp;nbsp;budget.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">admin</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 02 Oct 2007 02:16:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:blog.jasonantman.com,2007-10-02:2007/10/sun-blog/</guid><category>Sun Solaris Rutgers</category></item></channel></rss>
