feelings&lt;/a&gt; than I on the
subject, and many others, I felt the need to share some thoughts on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DRM&lt;/span&gt;
this&amp;nbsp;morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here at Rutgers, we had been promoting
&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruckus_Network"&gt;Ruckus&lt;/a&gt; for music
downloading. The idea was that if you go to Rutgers, you get to use
their service for free and download your music. I&amp;#8217;ve never used it. Even
if their software had &lt;em&gt;worked&lt;/em&gt; with Linux, it&amp;#8217;s still so badly &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DRM&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;ed
that I couldn&amp;#8217;t even burn the music to a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CD&lt;/span&gt;. Being an old-fashioned
person who has a regular old non-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;MP3&lt;/span&gt; cd player in my truck, what good
would that do&amp;nbsp;me?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, today Ruckus just shows&amp;nbsp;this:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Ruckus shutdown graphic" src="/GFX/ruckus_final.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ll admit it, I&amp;#8217;m not the least bit sad to see it go. And not just
because it was Windows-only at a time when Linux is gaining in
popularity and MacOS is all-out exploding. What was my real problem with
it? The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DRM&lt;/span&gt;. What good is a bunch of 1&amp;#8217;s and 0&amp;#8217;s if I can&amp;#8217;t use it the
way I like? You couldn&amp;#8217;t burn Ruckus music to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CD&lt;/span&gt;, and I doubt you could
use it on my ancient Sansa &lt;span class="caps"&gt;512MB&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MP3&lt;/span&gt; player either, as it doesn&amp;#8217;t
support &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DRM&lt;/span&gt; (and runs&amp;nbsp;Linux).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what&amp;#8217;s my final thought? From
&lt;a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/02/06/college-music-service-ruckus-shuts-down/"&gt;TechCrunch.com&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re told that music that has not passed its “renew date” still
works, but that music that has expired will no longer work because the
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DRM&lt;/span&gt; licensing server has apparently shut&amp;nbsp;down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DRM&lt;/span&gt; wasn&amp;#8217;t bad enough to begin with, the music you already have will
just &lt;strong&gt;stop working&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#8230; because the original distributor isn&amp;#8217;t there
anymore to tell it to&amp;nbsp;work.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="drm"></category><category term="music"></category><category term="rutgers"></category></entry><entry><title>Internet Security, Microsoft Lies</title><link href="http://newblog.jasonantman.com/2008/09/internet-security-microsoft-lies/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2008-09-16T23:24:00-04:00</updated><author><name>admin</name></author><id>tag:newblog.jasonantman.com,2008-09-16:2008/09/internet-security-microsoft-lies/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Internet&amp;nbsp;Security&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, this semester I&amp;#8217;m taking a class on Internet Security. Our textbook
is &lt;a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbninquiry.asp?ean=1423901304"&gt;Management of Internet Security, 2nd
Edition&lt;/a&gt;
by Michael E. Whitman and Herbert J. Mattord. It seems pretty basic, and
very much focused on the management side of things (as opposed to
technical). The table of contents is as&amp;nbsp;follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Introduction to the Management of Information&amp;nbsp;Security&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Planning for&amp;nbsp;Security&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Planning for&amp;nbsp;Contingencies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Information Security&amp;nbsp;Policy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Developing the Security&amp;nbsp;Program&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Security Management Models and&amp;nbsp;Practices&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Risk Management: Identifying and Assessing&amp;nbsp;Risk&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Risk Management: Assessing and Controlling&amp;nbsp;Risk&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Protection&amp;nbsp;Mechanisms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Personnel and&amp;nbsp;Security&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Law and&amp;nbsp;Ethics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Information Security Project&amp;nbsp;Management&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, given that it&amp;#8217;s really a &amp;#8220;management&amp;#8221; book, I can&amp;#8217;t say I&amp;#8217;m
surprised that it reads like an essay that was graded on a scale of
buzzwords-per-sentence. However, it seems to be missing the one chapter
that&amp;#8217;s the most important - actually, the only chapter that would be in
the book if I wrote it - &amp;#8220;How to get management to allocate the money
you need for proper security.&amp;#8221; In fact, skimming over the book, I found
a lot of content on general management planning, job descriptions,
sample policies, and a lot of other pie-in-the-sky stuff, but not one
concrete section dedicated to the most difficult part of security -
getting the &amp;#8220;resources&amp;#8221; to do it&amp;nbsp;right!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Microsoft&amp;nbsp;Lies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why we would spend time analyzing corporate mission statements in an
Internet Security class, I have no idea. That seems, to me, too much
like what we covered in &amp;#8220;Management of Technological Organizations.&amp;#8221;
But, we do, and one of the examples used is &lt;a href="http://www.microsoft.com/About/default.mspx"&gt;Microsoft&amp;#8217;s Mission and
Values statement&lt;/a&gt;. Perhaps,
being the F/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;OSS&lt;/span&gt; advocate that I am, my reading of it was a bit cynical.
Let&amp;#8217;s take a look at&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;At Microsoft, our mission and values are to help people and business
throughout the world realize their full potential.&amp;#8221; Well, we&amp;#8217;re off to a
good start. Aside from the fact that they want you to realize that
potential using &lt;strong&gt;only their software&lt;/strong&gt;, and use their power and money
to actively monopolize (or attempt to) most industries that they enter,
this seems pretty&amp;nbsp;run-of-the-mill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Corporate Citizenship:&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#8220;Every successful corporation has &lt;em&gt;a
responsibility to use its resources and influence to make a positive
impact on the world and its people&lt;/em&gt;. Microsoft’s Global Citizenship
Initiative is focused on mobilizing our resources across the company and
around the world, to create opportunities in the communities where we do
business, and to &lt;em&gt;fulfill our commitment to serving the public good
through innovative technologies and partnerships&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;#8221; Well. Now we&amp;#8217;re
getting somewhere. Apparently &amp;#8220;a positive impact on the world and its
people&amp;#8221; is defined as trying to monopolize every sector that Microsoft
touches, whether attempting to crush and then buy-out the competition,
or through flat-out
&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear,_uncertainty_and_doubt"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;FUD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and
billion-dollar marketing campaigns. Hmm&amp;#8230; innovative partnerships&amp;#8230; as
in&amp;nbsp;Novell?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Legal and Corporate Affairs:&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#8220;Microsoft’s Legal and Corporate Affairs
Group works on the cutting edge of business and regulatory issues around
the world.&amp;#8221; Well, I can&amp;#8217;t argue with that, they sure are on the cutting
edge. What started with Bill Gates mailing out whiny letters about
pirated Altair &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BASIC&lt;/span&gt; has now turned into a global juggernaut, capable of
forcing the creation of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISO&lt;/span&gt; standards at their whim, and successfully
quashing any dissent about obviously flawed and under-reviewed
&amp;#8220;standards&amp;#8221; (which, in fact, simply describe current software, rather
than setting any real&amp;nbsp;standard).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Values:&lt;/em&gt;As a company, and as individuals, we value &lt;strong&gt;integrity&lt;/strong&gt;,
&lt;strong&gt;honesty&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;openness&lt;/strong&gt;, personal excellence, &lt;strong&gt;constructive
self-criticism&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;continual self-improvement&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;mutual
respect&lt;/strong&gt;. We are committed to our customers and partners and have a
passion for technology. We take on big challenges, and pride ourselves
on seeing them through. &lt;strong&gt;We hold ourselves accountable to our
customers&lt;/strong&gt;, shareholders, partners, and employees by honoring our
commitments, providing results, and &lt;strong&gt;striving for the highest
quality&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;integrity&lt;/strong&gt; - i.e. not creating a draft &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISO&lt;/span&gt; standard and then
    &lt;a href="http://www.networkworld.com/news/2007/083007-microsoft-employee-offered-incentives-for.html"&gt;offering monetary incentives for
    acceptance&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;honesty&lt;/strong&gt; - when it works. Intentionally making Vista-Capable
    labeling so ambiguous that it even &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/09/business/09digi.html?_r=1&amp;amp;oref=slogin"&gt;confuses Microsoft
    executives&lt;/a&gt;?&amp;nbsp;Fine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;openness&lt;/strong&gt; um&amp;#8230; did they seriously say that? Openness like&amp;#8230;
    protocol interoperability? Standards that can be implemented without
    patent violations? An &amp;#8220;Open Specification Promise&amp;#8221; that doesn&amp;#8217;t come
    with a &lt;a href="http://www.microsoft.com/interop/osp/default.mspx"&gt;three page
    &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FAQ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;? Nope. Not&amp;nbsp;Microsoft.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;constructive self-criticism&lt;/strong&gt; - Ok, I&amp;#8217;ll give them this one. They
    do, rarely, criticize themselves. Though &amp;#8220;constructive&amp;#8221; usually
    means making comments about the poor design of a previous product,
    and suggesting that everyone upgrade to the new&amp;nbsp;version.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;continual self-improvement&lt;/strong&gt; - I&amp;#8217;ll give them this one too. In
    fact, they&amp;#8217;re so crazy about it that they&amp;#8217;ve been improving the same
    codebase for&amp;nbsp;decades!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;mutual respect&lt;/strong&gt; - See&amp;nbsp;above.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We hold ourselves accountable to our customers&lt;/strong&gt; - Ok. They &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt;
    offering to allow users to &lt;a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/5/f/4/5f4c83d3-833e-4f11-8cbd-699b0c164182/royaltyoemreferencesheet.pdf"&gt;downgrade from Vista to
    &lt;span class="caps"&gt;XP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;striving for the highest quality&lt;/strong&gt; - I don&amp;#8217;t think so. They&amp;#8217;re
    striving for products that have the highest &lt;em&gt;market share&lt;/em&gt;. As long
    as the quality is acceptable to the majority of users, and the
    products do what the majority of users need, that&amp;#8217;s fine. But
    wait&amp;#8230; apparently they even missed &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; goal with&amp;nbsp;Vista.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is just the opinion of one person. My motivations may be diverse,
and surely there&amp;#8217;s a bit of zealotry in there. After all, if Ford told
me I couldn&amp;#8217;t put fog lights on my car myself, I had to bring it to the
dealer and pay $400, I&amp;#8217;d stop buying their cars - and make sure everyone
else knew what they did. But there&amp;#8217;s also my ever-present desire to make
sure people know both sides of the story, and all the facts. The
mainstream media (specifically dumbed-down television) rarely reports on
the less cheerful side of Microsoft, like the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISO&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#8220;standard&amp;#8221;
&lt;a href="http://www.networkworld.com/news/2007/083007-microsoft-employee-offered-incentives-for.html"&gt;scandal&lt;/a&gt;,
or the &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/09/business/09digi.html?_r=1&amp;amp;oref=slogin"&gt;Vista
letters&lt;/a&gt;,
or the
&lt;a href="http://yro.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=08/04/22/2032232&amp;amp;from=rss"&gt;Vista-Capable&lt;/a&gt;
fiasco. And I find this to be horribly disturbing. Many people don&amp;#8217;t
realize that there &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; alternatives to Microsoft products, even ones
that are provided by such big names as &lt;a href="http://www.sun.com"&gt;Sun
Microsystems&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.ibm.com"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;IBM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. But,
most striking, is Microsoft&amp;#8217;s overwhelming monopoly. Windows&amp;#8217; market
share is currently
&lt;a href="http://marketshare.hitslink.com/report.aspx?qprid=8"&gt;90.66%&lt;/a&gt; or higher.
I ask you, what other industries which affect not only consumers, but
nearly every aspect of our daily lives (as computing does) would be
allowed to have such a monopoly? It has happened in many other American
industries - oil, steel, the railroads, telephone service. Where is the
government&amp;nbsp;now?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happened to the America that made massive monopolies illegal? Have
we forgotten a supremely part of our history that began in 1980 with the
Sherman Act? Or even the recent events with Bell? In order to truly
stimulate competition in the software industry, and provide for not only
choice but the improved quality, reliability, and security that comes
with true software competition, something needs to be done. For
starters, how about breaking Microsoft into separate entities - browser,
Office, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OS&lt;/span&gt;, server, etc. And - the important part - preventing any
package sales, discounts, or bundling between the separate types of
software (and separate&amp;nbsp;companies).&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="microsoft"></category><category term="rutgers"></category><category term="school"></category><category term="security"></category></entry><entry><title>Practical PHP and MySQL</title><link href="http://newblog.jasonantman.com/2008/06/practical-php-and-mysql/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2008-06-26T14:29:00-04:00</updated><author><name>admin</name></author><id>tag:newblog.jasonantman.com,2008-06-26:2008/06/practical-php-and-mysql/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m taking a summer course in Building Data Driven Websites - not that I
thought I&amp;#8217;d learn much in such a course at
&lt;a href="http://scils.rutgers.edu"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SCILS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but I&amp;#8217;d like to graduate on time, and
need the credits, and Bill Crosbie is just the type of rare teacher that
can keep even me awake and interested. Our book is &lt;a href="http://www.informit.com/store/product.aspx?isbn=0132239973"&gt;Practical &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt; and
MySQL: Building Eight Dynamic Web
Applications&lt;/a&gt;
(&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Practical-PHP-MySQL-Building-Applications/dp/0132239973"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;)
by &lt;a href="http://www.jonobacon.org/"&gt;Jono Bacon&lt;/a&gt;. Now, I know it&amp;#8217;s not a
&lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; book like, say, &lt;a href="http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596003432/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ESA3&lt;/span&gt; by
Frisch&lt;/a&gt;, which has a healthy
&lt;a href="http://www.aeleen.com/home.htm"&gt;web presense&lt;/a&gt;. But this thing is all
code and doesn&amp;#8217;t even have a web site, let alone easy code&amp;nbsp;downloads!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book does come with a heavily customized Ubuntu LiveCD. However,
when I popped it in my &lt;a href="http://www.opensuse.org"&gt;OpenSuSE workstation&lt;/a&gt;,
I couldn&amp;#8217;t really make much out of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CD&lt;/span&gt; - there was certainly no
easy-to-find &amp;#8220;this is the code&amp;#8221; directory. Well, after some exploring, I
mounted the &lt;a href="http://squashfs.sourceforge.net/"&gt;SquashFS&lt;/a&gt; filesystem and
poked around a bit. Strange&amp;#8230; seems to only have one real user (root)
and, though they claim this is a fully-functional &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LAMP&lt;/span&gt; server, no Apache
or MySQL. Really weird. Well, after poking for a few minutes, I found
the holy grail - &lt;code&gt;/root/.bash_history&lt;/code&gt; was intact! Just a quick look
through it with &lt;code&gt;less&lt;/code&gt; and I found what I was looking for: &lt;code&gt;/opt/lampp&lt;/code&gt;.
It appears that the install is actually ApacheFriends&amp;#8217;
&lt;a href="http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp-linux.html"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;LAMPP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;span class="caps"&gt;XAMPP&lt;/span&gt; for
Linux (gotta wonder if the guy writing this book doesn&amp;#8217;t even know how
to install Apache&amp;#8230; I&amp;#8217;m sure &lt;span class="caps"&gt;XAMPP&lt;/span&gt; for Linux is more bloated than a
customized build of Apache/MySQL/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt; from source, especially since it&amp;#8217;s
only being used to host 8 sample projects, so a lot could be left&amp;nbsp;out).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, it appears that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LAMPP&lt;/span&gt; is running in a chroot&amp;#8217;ed environment. The
actual sample code is rooted at &lt;code&gt;/opt/lampp/htdocs/sites&lt;/code&gt;. It seems that
&lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt; files are also owned by root and chmod&amp;#8217;ed 777! And
the top-level &lt;code&gt;index.php&lt;/code&gt; file makes use of absolute links, so obviously
he never thought that someone may want to copy the sample code and use
it on a &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just can&amp;#8217;t imagine someone who&amp;#8217;s a beginner with Linux, let alone a
Windows person, trying to get this source code onto a machine where they
can actually play with it. And&amp;#8230; to make the situation worse&amp;#8230; the
LiveCD has vi and vim, but no Emacs!!!!&amp;nbsp;Eeeek!!&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="books"></category><category term="linux"></category><category term="PHP"></category><category term="programming"></category><category term="rutgers"></category></entry><entry><title>SunSPOT; CarPC; MediaWiki Logging</title><link href="http://newblog.jasonantman.com/2008/05/sunspot-carpc-mediawiki-logging/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2008-05-07T10:03:00-04:00</updated><author><name>admin</name></author><id>tag:newblog.jasonantman.com,2008-05-07:2008/05/sunspot-carpc-mediawiki-logging/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Well, finals season is upon me. That&amp;#8217;s probably why I haven&amp;#8217;t been
posting much lately (I haven&amp;#8217;t even been checking &lt;a href="http://reader.google.com/"&gt;Google
Reader&lt;/a&gt; - I&amp;#8217;ll have to delete a few thousand
entries when I get back into the swing of things). I&amp;#8217;ve been pretty
busy, between studying, projects, and work. I&amp;#8217;ll be working 4 days a
week through June 20th, as well as taking night classes 4 nigths a week
(unfortunately not the same 4 days) through July 3, in an effort to
graduate Rutgers on time (after transferring in and also switching
majors). Work after June 20th is up in the air - who knows how hard the
budget cuts will&amp;nbsp;hit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My internship as the Sun Microsystems Campus Ambassador to Rutgers is
over on May 12th. I got a chance to do the Rutgers &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IT&lt;/span&gt; Vendor Fair with
Sun, and met a few cool people - especially including Matt McGrath of
&lt;a href="http://www.conres.com/"&gt;Continental Resources&lt;/a&gt;, a Sun Strategic iForce
Partner, who&amp;#8217;s doing some wonderful things with the &lt;a href="http://www.sun.com/solutions/landing/industry/education/edu_essentials.jsp"&gt;Sun Education
Essentials Matching Grant
Program&lt;/a&gt;,
and &lt;a href="http://opsamericas.com/"&gt;Skip Paul&lt;/a&gt;, a Linux Systems Engineer for
Novell&amp;#8217;s Open Platform Solutions group. I also finally cracked open my
demo set of &lt;a href="http://www.sunspotworld.com/"&gt;SunSPOT&lt;/a&gt;s. Wonderful little
devices, radio, run Java on the bare metal, and have temperature
sensors, accelerometers, and liberal I/O. My first development exereice
will probably be making a temperature and acceleration data logger for
my truck, but there&amp;#8217;s surely more to come. They&amp;#8217;re&amp;nbsp;great!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My newest project - which I&amp;#8217;m hoping to spend nearly the whole summer on
- is the &lt;a href="http://www.jasonantman.com/tuxtruck/"&gt;TuxTruck&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;#8217;ve been
frustrated with the lack of &amp;#8220;smartness&amp;#8221; in my truck (an 06 Ford F-250),
not to mention having to remember my &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MP3&lt;/span&gt; player so I can listen to
podcasts on the way to work, and having so many gadgets in my truck. So,
the solution is obvious: a Linux-based
&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpc"&gt;CarPC&lt;/a&gt;. A nice little Mini-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ATX&lt;/span&gt; box
under a seat, with a 7&amp;#8221; pull-out touchscreen in the dash (replacing the
factory radio). It&amp;#8217;s a big, complicated, and expensive project - but I
want one, and I could use some experience with smaller systems.&lt;br /&gt;
The major features I have&amp;nbsp;planned:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Realtime &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPS&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;navigation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hands-free bluetooth calls from my cell, with address book, routing
    to contact address, possibly voice&amp;nbsp;dialing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Realtime&amp;nbsp;weather&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;OBD&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;II&lt;/span&gt; interface, for vehicle diagnostics and fuel
    efficiency/performance&amp;nbsp;profiling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Audio - at a minimum searching and playing MP3s, and automatically
    downloading podcasts and throwing them in a playlist. Perhaps also
    an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AM&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;FM&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;tuner&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s not an easy project. So far, the major challenges seem to&amp;nbsp;be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No full-featured &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPS&lt;/span&gt; navigation package available. The ones that are
    available don&amp;#8217;t seem to be too easy to integrate into my planned
    &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GUI&lt;/span&gt;, which will allot them 800x420 pixels (on an 800x480 screen) and
    requre the bottom toolbar to be always&amp;nbsp;available.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to handle processing of multiple data streams that require
    near-real-time processing - specifically, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPS&lt;/span&gt; with text-to-speech,
    turn-by-turn directions, plus playing audio, plus responding to an
    incoming phone call in a timely manner, pausing the audio, and
    stopping &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPS&lt;/span&gt; audio but continuing&amp;nbsp;navigation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whether to install a smaller stereo and use aux input for audio, or
    totally rip out the stereo, use an amp with the computer as its only
    input, and then how to control&amp;nbsp;volume?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be more to come in the future. For now, take a look at &lt;a href="https://github.com/jantman/tuxtruck"&gt;the
TuxTruck github&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update Saturday, March 2, 2013&lt;/strong&gt; - I&amp;#8217;m in the process of migrating my
legacy &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CVS&lt;/span&gt; and Subversion repositories to
&lt;a href="http://github.com/jantman/"&gt;github.com&lt;/a&gt;. The forgotten &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SVN&lt;/span&gt; repository
for TuxTruck has been migrated there, and the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CVS&lt;/span&gt; repository will soon
be moved there as well. Tuxtruck.org has been permanently taken offline
and redirected to the GitHub&amp;nbsp;repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mediawiki Logging&lt;/strong&gt; - I recently
had a situation where I had to confirm how much work someone had done on
a MediaWiki-based project. The Recent Changes page only goes back 30
days, and walking through the History of each page is a pain. After
looking around in the database a bit, I found a few tables of&amp;nbsp;interest:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Table &amp;#8220;users&amp;#8221; includes fields &amp;#8220;user_touched&amp;#8221; (last time the user
    was updated) and &amp;#8220;user_editcount&amp;#8221; (a really simple count of the
    users&amp;#8217; number of&amp;nbsp;edits).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Table &amp;#8220;recentchanges&amp;#8221; holds a lot of data&amp;#8230; seemingly the entire
    life of the&amp;nbsp;wiki&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

Things have been horribly busy
in the school world, and I have some new projects I&amp;#8217;m working on as
well. Unfortunately, due to limited resources at the moment, I haven&amp;#8217;t
been able to give Zenoss a try. If I eventually find a nice 25-30U rack
for the &lt;a href="http://www.jasonantman.com/wiki/index.php/Jasonantman.com_Hardware"&gt;hardware running
JasonAntman.com&lt;/a&gt;
(in the basement of my suburban home, so headroom is limited to about
six feet), I&amp;#8217;ll probably move one or two machines from my apartment back
there, reorganize things, and setup a Zenoss test (*if* I can get Xen
to play well with some &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OS&lt;/span&gt; that has Zenoss RPMs, or give up and compile
from source).&lt;br /&gt;
A few of my new&amp;nbsp;projects:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some embedded Linux&amp;nbsp;work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Getting my new &lt;a href="http://www.deluogps.com/product.php?id=10-311-00"&gt;Deluo &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USB&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WAAS&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; working with
    my eeePC, and eventually add software for mapping wireless&amp;nbsp;networks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mount an external 2.4GHz antenna on my truck, so I can hop on
    &lt;a href="http://ruwireless.rutgers.edu/"&gt;RUwireless&lt;/a&gt; without leaving the
    comfort of my home on&amp;nbsp;wheels.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get a &amp;#8220;N&amp;#8221; wireless card and beta the wireless-N at&amp;nbsp;Rutgers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Figure out development for PalmOS, and write a program to sync my
    Palm calendar with &lt;a href="http://calendar.google.com/"&gt;Google Calendar&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;over-the-air.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do some work with a radio scanner and a system at home for recording
    and logging (maybe even
    &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MDC-1200"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;MDC1200&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;decoding).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My pet peeve for the day - blogs and other websites that don&amp;#8217;t list a
date last updated. I&amp;#8217;ve been looking around for alternatives to
&lt;a href="http://cvs.codeyard.net/kpilot/"&gt;KPilot&lt;/a&gt;, and I have to look through
all of the Google results, and figure out how old they are based on
version numbers and which Palm devices are&amp;nbsp;listed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, from Rutgers Telecommunications, this is what RUwireless looked
like over spring break, and the Monday that everyone came&amp;nbsp;back:&lt;/p&gt;
