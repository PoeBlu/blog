for over 60,000 users. They&amp;#8217;re a mix of Windows and Linux, with some old
Solaris stuff thrown in there. The one thing they have in common is
they&amp;#8217;re all hand-built, hand-configured, and old. They&amp;#8217;ve been around
for a while. At the moment, we don&amp;#8217;t even have an adequate backup&amp;nbsp;system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, being the closest thing to a SysAdmin we have (my official title is
still Student Systems Programmer), it&amp;#8217;s my job to build a new
installation, configuration and backup infrastructure. We&amp;#8217;ve already
standardized on &lt;a href="http://www.centos.org"&gt;CentOS&lt;/a&gt; as a University-wide
distro, and have a local full mirror, so I don&amp;#8217;t need to choose a
distro. I do, however, have to plan the installation and backup
architecture. The main requirements&amp;nbsp;are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lowest overall time for bare-metal recovery to a working&amp;nbsp;system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ease of use, as people other than myself will need to administer it
    (so they should be able to do so from a cheat sheet in the&amp;nbsp;wiki).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Repeatability - it should be easy and intuitive to make an
    almost-exact-copy of a&amp;nbsp;machine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started a thread a few days ago on the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SAGE&lt;/span&gt; mailing list, which you
can find
&lt;a href="http://mailman.sage.org/pipermail/sage-members/2009/msg00447.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the moment, it looks like the general idea that I&amp;#8217;m going with is to
use &lt;a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Anaconda/Kickstart"&gt;Kickstart&lt;/a&gt; to
install the systems, using a basic and minimal Kickstart file. Basic
package selection (minimalist) with just what&amp;#8217;s needed to configure the
system with a hostname and network settings for the management &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VLAN&lt;/span&gt;.
I&amp;#8217;ll then have Kickstart install and configure a configuration
management package - I&amp;#8217;m leaning towards
&lt;a href="http://reductivelabs.com/products/puppet/"&gt;Puppet&lt;/a&gt; over
&lt;a href="http://www.cfengine.org/"&gt;Cfengine&lt;/a&gt; and am starting testing. The config
management software will handle all of the customization for the system
(everything different from the base generic Kickstart install) so it&amp;#8217;s
all kept under the control of config management from step&amp;nbsp;1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final part is a backup system, mainly for whatever eventually -
whether out of human error or simple laziness - ends up out of the
config management system&amp;#8217;s control. Our previous &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SA&lt;/span&gt; had settled on
&lt;a href="http://www.zmanda.com/"&gt;Zmanda&lt;/a&gt;, the paid version of
&lt;a href="http://www.amanda.org/"&gt;Amanda&lt;/a&gt;, which comes with specific plugins for
MySQL and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MSSQL&lt;/span&gt;. I&amp;#8217;m also looking at &lt;a href="http://www.bacula.org"&gt;Bacula&lt;/a&gt;,
mainly because of its&amp;#8217; advanced features, scheduling (especially the new
scheduling in Bacula 3) and&amp;nbsp;scalability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The beauty that I see in having Kickstart do something minimal and then
letting Puppet handle the rest is that (especially since we&amp;#8217;ve
standardized on SunFire X4100&amp;#8217;s with identical configurations) I can
kickstart and rack up a few spare machines, and to get them up and
running all I need to do is power them up (iLOM) and tell Puppet what to
make&amp;nbsp;them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m currently starting testing of both Puppet itself and getting
Kickstart to start the puppet install and daemon (instructions from
&lt;a href="http://watzmann.net/blog/index.php?cat=21"&gt;David Lutterkort&amp;#8217;s blog (Red Hat software
engineer)&lt;/a&gt;). We&amp;#8217;ll see how
everything&amp;nbsp;goes&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">admin</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 06 May 2009 08:42:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:newblog.jasonantman.com,2009-05-06:2009/05/building-a-rebuild-able-site/</guid><category>backup</category><category>configuration</category><category>kickstart</category><category>linux</category><category>puppet</category><category>recovery</category><category>work</category></item></channel></rss>
