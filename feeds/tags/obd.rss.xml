That&amp;#8217;s probably why I haven&amp;#8217;t been
posting much lately (I haven&amp;#8217;t even been checking &lt;a href="http://reader.google.com/"&gt;Google
Reader&lt;/a&gt; - I&amp;#8217;ll have to delete a few thousand
entries when I get back into the swing of things). I&amp;#8217;ve been pretty
busy, between studying, projects, and work. I&amp;#8217;ll be working 4 days a
week through June 20th, as well as taking night classes 4 nigths a week
(unfortunately not the same 4 days) through July 3, in an effort to
graduate Rutgers on time (after transferring in and also switching
majors). Work after June 20th is up in the air - who knows how hard the
budget cuts will&amp;nbsp;hit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My internship as the Sun Microsystems Campus Ambassador to Rutgers is
over on May 12th. I got a chance to do the Rutgers &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IT&lt;/span&gt; Vendor Fair with
Sun, and met a few cool people - especially including Matt McGrath of
&lt;a href="http://www.conres.com/"&gt;Continental Resources&lt;/a&gt;, a Sun Strategic iForce
Partner, who&amp;#8217;s doing some wonderful things with the &lt;a href="http://www.sun.com/solutions/landing/industry/education/edu_essentials.jsp"&gt;Sun Education
Essentials Matching Grant
Program&lt;/a&gt;,
and &lt;a href="http://opsamericas.com/"&gt;Skip Paul&lt;/a&gt;, a Linux Systems Engineer for
Novell&amp;#8217;s Open Platform Solutions group. I also finally cracked open my
demo set of &lt;a href="http://www.sunspotworld.com/"&gt;SunSPOT&lt;/a&gt;s. Wonderful little
devices, radio, run Java on the bare metal, and have temperature
sensors, accelerometers, and liberal I/O. My first development exereice
will probably be making a temperature and acceleration data logger for
my truck, but there&amp;#8217;s surely more to come. They&amp;#8217;re&amp;nbsp;great!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My newest project - which I&amp;#8217;m hoping to spend nearly the whole summer on
- is the &lt;a href="http://www.jasonantman.com/tuxtruck/"&gt;TuxTruck&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;#8217;ve been
frustrated with the lack of &amp;#8220;smartness&amp;#8221; in my truck (an 06 Ford F-250),
not to mention having to remember my &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MP3&lt;/span&gt; player so I can listen to
podcasts on the way to work, and having so many gadgets in my truck. So,
the solution is obvious: a Linux-based
&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpc"&gt;CarPC&lt;/a&gt;. A nice little Mini-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ATX&lt;/span&gt; box
under a seat, with a 7&amp;#8221; pull-out touchscreen in the dash (replacing the
factory radio). It&amp;#8217;s a big, complicated, and expensive project - but I
want one, and I could use some experience with smaller systems.&lt;br /&gt;
The major features I have&amp;nbsp;planned:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Realtime &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPS&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;navigation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hands-free bluetooth calls from my cell, with address book, routing
    to contact address, possibly voice&amp;nbsp;dialing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Realtime&amp;nbsp;weather&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;OBD&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;II&lt;/span&gt; interface, for vehicle diagnostics and fuel
    efficiency/performance&amp;nbsp;profiling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Audio - at a minimum searching and playing MP3s, and automatically
    downloading podcasts and throwing them in a playlist. Perhaps also
    an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AM&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;FM&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;tuner&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s not an easy project. So far, the major challenges seem to&amp;nbsp;be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No full-featured &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPS&lt;/span&gt; navigation package available. The ones that are
    available don&amp;#8217;t seem to be too easy to integrate into my planned
    &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GUI&lt;/span&gt;, which will allot them 800x420 pixels (on an 800x480 screen) and
    requre the bottom toolbar to be always&amp;nbsp;available.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to handle processing of multiple data streams that require
    near-real-time processing - specifically, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPS&lt;/span&gt; with text-to-speech,
    turn-by-turn directions, plus playing audio, plus responding to an
    incoming phone call in a timely manner, pausing the audio, and
    stopping &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPS&lt;/span&gt; audio but continuing&amp;nbsp;navigation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whether to install a smaller stereo and use aux input for audio, or
    totally rip out the stereo, use an amp with the computer as its only
    input, and then how to control&amp;nbsp;volume?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be more to come in the future. For now, take a look at &lt;a href="https://github.com/jantman/tuxtruck"&gt;the
TuxTruck github&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update Saturday, March 2, 2013&lt;/strong&gt; - I&amp;#8217;m in the process of migrating my
legacy &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CVS&lt;/span&gt; and Subversion repositories to
&lt;a href="http://github.com/jantman/"&gt;github.com&lt;/a&gt;. The forgotten &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SVN&lt;/span&gt; repository
for TuxTruck has been migrated there, and the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CVS&lt;/span&gt; repository will soon
be moved there as well. Tuxtruck.org has been permanently taken offline
and redirected to the GitHub&amp;nbsp;repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mediawiki Logging&lt;/strong&gt; - I recently
had a situation where I had to confirm how much work someone had done on
a MediaWiki-based project. The Recent Changes page only goes back 30
days, and walking through the History of each page is a pain. After
looking around in the database a bit, I found a few tables of&amp;nbsp;interest:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Table &amp;#8220;users&amp;#8221; includes fields &amp;#8220;user_touched&amp;#8221; (last time the user
    was updated) and &amp;#8220;user_editcount&amp;#8221; (a really simple count of the
    users&amp;#8217; number of&amp;nbsp;edits).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Table &amp;#8220;recentchanges&amp;#8221; holds a lot of data&amp;#8230; seemingly the entire
    life of the&amp;nbsp;wiki&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
