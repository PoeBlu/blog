multimode fiber, but I decided to use copper GBICs for the new boxes
that have onboard Gig-E ports. Unfortunately, $100+ for Cisco GBICs was
way too much for me, so I found some third-party GBICs on Ebay from
&lt;a href="http://members.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewUserPage&amp;amp;userid=tnetusa"&gt;TNet
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;USA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
right in Fairfield,&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NJ&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to make sure the GBICs work right, so I happened to find out
about the undocumented CatOS command `show sprom [mod/port]` which
shows the serial &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PROM&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;information.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="catos"></category><category term="cisco"></category><category term="gbic"></category><category term="networking"></category></entry><entry><title>Vyatta Initial Impressions</title><link href="https://blog.jasonantman.com/2009/02/vyatta-initial-impressions/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2009-02-26T10:06:00-05:00</published><updated>2009-02-26T10:06:00-05:00</updated><author><name>admin</name></author><id>tag:blog.jasonantman.com,2009-02-26:/2009/02/vyatta-initial-impressions/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m part-way through the major overhaul of my home network (hosting this

blog and everything else jasonantman.com) that I&amp;#8217;ve been planning for
quite some time. The current hardware is&amp;#8230; uh&amp;#8230; currently&amp;#8230; described
on my Hardware
page, but I soon plan on ditching the wiki and moving to a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CMS&lt;/span&gt; for my
entire&amp;nbsp;site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, so far I&amp;#8217;ve decommissioned my aged &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HP&lt;/span&gt; ProCurve 2424M switch
and replaced it with used but less-aged Cisco 2948G from &lt;a href="http://horizondatacom.com/"&gt;Horizon
Datacom&lt;/a&gt; (purchased on Ebay). Quite an
upgrade. In order to handle network backups a little better, I&amp;#8217;m also
adding a Cisco 4912G 12-port Gigabit (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GBIC&lt;/span&gt;) aggregation switch for the
administrative/backup &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VLAN&lt;/span&gt; - though this was purchased via ebay from
&lt;a href="http://stores.ebay.com/RedApe-Technologies"&gt;RedApe Technologies&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PA&lt;/span&gt;.
The switch came with 12 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;1000BASE&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SX&lt;/span&gt; GBICs, and I plan to do a mix of
copper (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;1000BASE&lt;/span&gt;-T) where it&amp;#8217;s already available (onboard NICs) and
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;1000BASE&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SX&lt;/span&gt; where there&amp;#8217;s enough room in the box for a&amp;nbsp;card.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the hardware side, I also have 2 new boxes - a set of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HP&lt;/span&gt; Proliant
&lt;a href="http://h18000.www1.hp.com/products/quickspecs/11049_na/11049_na.HTML"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DL360&lt;/span&gt;
G2&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8216;s
from &lt;a href="http://www.mjsglobal.com/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;MJS&lt;/span&gt; Global&lt;/a&gt;, who I&amp;#8217;ve done business
with before. The prices were great, and though one of them showed up
with a faulty temperature sensor that prevents boot, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MJS&lt;/span&gt; has been
wonderful and is shipping me a replacement motherboard. One of the boxes
will be running &lt;a href="http://www.vyatta.org/"&gt;Vyatta&lt;/a&gt; (vee-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AH&lt;/span&gt;-tha) &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VC5&lt;/span&gt;
router/firewall software, and the other will be a new services box
running internal &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DNS&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DHCP&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NTP&lt;/span&gt;, and whatever&amp;nbsp;else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the hardware side, I&amp;#8217;m also planning some extended downtime a few
weekends from now, when I should finally have a 42U rack to replace the
Sears shelves my equipment is now on. It&amp;#8217;ll be a fun-filled evening of
racking equipment and re-patching everything. Also, hopefully within a
few weeks, I&amp;#8217;ll be moving my &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WAN&lt;/span&gt; pipe from Verizon FiOS residential to
Optimum Business, which is essentially re-packaged residential but
provides 5 static IPs, no blocked ports, and 30 Mbps down/5 Mbps&amp;nbsp;up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vyatta&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When planning this upgrade, I think I looked at every open source router
package out there, as well as some of the lower-end or older Cisco
models. I&amp;#8217;m currently running &lt;a href="http://www.ipcop.org/"&gt;IPcop&lt;/a&gt;, which does
everything I need except it doesn&amp;#8217;t handle multiple &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WAN&lt;/span&gt; IPs, and all
configuration is via a web interface - which means every time I want to
make a change remotely (and during the week I&amp;#8217;m not home) I have to
forward &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTTPS&lt;/span&gt; over &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SSH&lt;/span&gt;. After doing an extensive feature comparison, I
ended up narrowing it down to a relative newcomer - Vyatta. Though I
don&amp;#8217;t know how much of it is marketing hype, they are targeted squarely
at Cisco, and provide relatively enterprise-level features; a
JunOS-based &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CLI&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BGP&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OSPF&lt;/span&gt;, and all of the other important&amp;nbsp;stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I attempted an install of Vyatta &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CE&lt;/span&gt; 5 Beta on one of the
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DL360G2&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s. The only real problem that I found was the install script
doesn&amp;#8217;t support &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CCISS&lt;/span&gt; drives, as found in the Proliants, but a few
manual hacks to the script fixed that. By far the best thing about
Vyatta is it&amp;#8217;s based on vanilla Debian Lenny, and full root shell access
is available, so modifying the install script - or even adding
non-Vyatta packages - is a cinch. I haven&amp;#8217;t really played around with it
too much, but it appears to be a wonderful mix of Linux and an
enterprise router &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CLI&lt;/span&gt;. While root has a full &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BASH&lt;/span&gt; shell, and the Vyata
commands are all done as shell aliases (so users still have access to
shell primitives and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OS&lt;/span&gt; commands), configuration is accomplished via a
JunOS-like command set. You still get &amp;#8220;commit&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;rollback&amp;#8221; in config
mode, and can still do fun things like save and load configs to/from
tftp, ftp and &lt;em&gt;http&lt;/em&gt;. On the other hand, I doubt I&amp;#8217;ll do config backups
that way since I can just use scp or&amp;nbsp;sftp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Vyatta box will probably go home this weekend, and get hooked up to
the network for config-only use (and I can always get in via iLO on the
hardware) and hopefully come up sometime in the next few&amp;nbsp;weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, the most daunting task is figuring out how to get all of
the existing links to my site to work - since jantman.dyndns.org will be
legacy, and most of the site structure will probably change to use
name-based vhosts. Lately I&amp;#8217;ve been trying to use the real subdomains in
all of my public links, so the transition (planned for a while) will
work, but I&amp;#8217;m sure there are still plenty of links out there that will
need dealing with (maybe keep port 10011 serving &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTTP&lt;/span&gt; with a massive
mod_rewrite script to redirect to the right place???), as well as
checking everything on the web server to make sure there aren&amp;#8217;t any
absolute URLs (like&amp;nbsp;WordPress).&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="cisco"></category><category term="networking"></category><category term="router"></category><category term="vyatta"></category></entry></feed>
