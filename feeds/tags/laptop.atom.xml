Well, it&amp;#8217;s nearing the end of March, so it&amp;#8217;s a good thing I didn&amp;#8217;t make any formal New Year&amp;#8217;s resolutions! In general I&amp;#8217;ve been really busy at work with some esoteric big-company stuff, and really busy in my personal life as well with a new car and a bunch of projects around the house (including trying my hand at building a small shelving unit completely by hand, including some simple&amp;nbsp;joinery).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two weeks ago my company replaced my four-year-old (mid-2015) MacBook Pro 11,4 (original &lt;a href="https://github.com/jantman/workstation-bootstrap/blob/master/macbookpro11%2C4_install.md"&gt;install notes&lt;/a&gt;) with a shiny, brand-new MacBook Pro 15,4 A1990. I&amp;#8217;d been dual-booting my previous &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MBP&lt;/span&gt; between Linux (for any real work) and MacOS (for Netflix and quick Googles while at home) as I&amp;#8217;ve been doing with MacBook Pros for almost a decade now, and loved it. Unfortunately, as is described in detail at &lt;a href="https://github.com/Dunedan/mbp-2016-linux/issues/71"&gt;Dunedan/mbp-2016-linux Issue #71&lt;/a&gt; as well as numerous &lt;a href="https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/463422/how-can-you-get-any-version-of-linux-to-see-the-2018-macbook-pro-ssd/479544"&gt;other&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://forum.level1techs.com/t/linux-doesnt-support-t2-as-a-ssd-controller-apples-t2-secure-boot-chip-is-blocking-usage-of-linux-in-t2-chip-macs/134832/36"&gt;places&lt;/a&gt; online, because of the T2 security chip acting as the storage controller for the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SSD&lt;/span&gt;, it&amp;#8217;s currently impossible to install Linux on the built-in SSDs of the latest generation MacBook Pro. So I threw in the towel and requested to be re-platformed to a Dell laptop, and listed my &lt;a href="https://github.com/jantman/puppet-archlinux-macbookretina"&gt;puppet-archlinux-macbookretina&lt;/a&gt; module as unsupported and in need of a&amp;nbsp;maintainer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week I picked up my &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; new work laptop, a Dell Precision 5530. I&amp;#8217;d asked about an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;XPS&lt;/span&gt; 15 as those seem to be on par with the MacBook Pro in terms of price and specs, but when you work at a company with 34,000 employees and they tell you &amp;#8220;our developer laptop is a Precision 5530&amp;#8221; and you&amp;#8217;re a developer, that&amp;#8217;s the laptop you get. I was pleased to find out, though, that &lt;strong&gt;the internal hardware of the Precision 5530 is extremely similar to the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;XPS&lt;/span&gt; 15 9570&lt;/strong&gt;, including having some of the same&amp;nbsp;issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My odyssey of getting &lt;a href="https://www.archlinux.org/"&gt;Arch Linux&lt;/a&gt; - my desktop distribution of choice for the past six years - installed on the new Dell laptop took me thirty hours or so (conservatively) over the course of one work day and four afternoons/evenings. The first day was mostly spent getting up to speed on changes in Arch in the past few years and the current best way to handle &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LUKS&lt;/span&gt;/dm-crypt encryption on an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EFI&lt;/span&gt; system with NVMe storage. My first install was completely ruined when I got to the (literally) last step and realized that I&amp;#8217;d forgotten to create an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EFI&lt;/span&gt; system partition (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ESP&lt;/span&gt;), so I started over. Luckily, as usual, I&amp;#8217;d &lt;a href="https://github.com/jantman/workstation-bootstrap/blob/master/precision5530_install.md"&gt;documented&lt;/a&gt; every step of the install process in excruciating&amp;nbsp;detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I finally got the system installed, I ran up against an interesting problem: when I launched Xorg, the laptop screen was either black (no backlight on at all), backlight black with no image, or flashing on and off. I fought with this for the better part of two days before I decided to try connecting an external display, and sure enough, &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; worked fine. I spent another two days or so with the laptop hooked up to an external monitor, repeating everything I&amp;#8217;d done before, trying every combination I could think of of graphics drivers (nvidia and nouveau, intel i915 and not), graphics-related kernel parameters, Nvidia Optimus / &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PRIME&lt;/span&gt; software, etc. Finally, when I was well past my wits end and turned back to Google, I found a kernel bug for the issue and an eight-character patch that fixed&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-solution"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#the-solution"&gt;The&amp;nbsp;Solution&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out that the non-functional laptop display on these models is caused by &lt;a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/7769db5883841b03de544a35a71ff528d4131c17"&gt;this commit&lt;/a&gt; to the kernel &lt;code&gt;i915&lt;/code&gt; driver. The commit specifically effects embedded Display Port (eDP) displays, and changes the link configuration algorithm from the older variant that uses more data lanes with a slower link speed (&amp;#8220;wide and slow&amp;#8221;) to the newer eDP standard&amp;#8217;s recommendation of fewer lanes with a higher link speed (&amp;#8220;fast and narrow&amp;#8221;). Unfortunately, it seems that the hardware in some of these Dell laptops will not function with this new method (even though the specification it was introduced in is &lt;em&gt;six&lt;/em&gt; years old and, according to the commit message, they should be reporting that they&amp;#8217;re compatible with&amp;nbsp;it).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After another exhaustive Google search lead me to the &lt;a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Dell_XPS_15_9570"&gt;Dell &lt;span class="caps"&gt;XPS&lt;/span&gt; 15 9570 Arch Wiki page&lt;/a&gt;, which contains a &lt;a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Dell_XPS_15_9570#Built-in_screen_flickers_or_does_not_come_on_with_Linux_kernel_5.0.x"&gt;troubleshooting section&lt;/a&gt; describing exactly this problem (well&amp;#8230; it does now&amp;#8230;) and pointing to &lt;a href="https://bugs.archlinux.org/task/61964"&gt;ArchLinux bug 61964&lt;/a&gt;. Somehow I found my way to the relevant upstream bug, &lt;a href="https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=109959"&gt;FreeDesktop.org bug 109959&lt;/a&gt;, which contains both multiple reports of the same issue as well as two kernel patches which fix&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Applying the noted kernel patches - and switching from &lt;code&gt;nvidia&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;nvidia-dkms&lt;/code&gt; to support the custom kernel - fixed the bug completely, and graphics on the laptop now work&amp;nbsp;perfectly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For anyone else who&amp;#8217;s running Arch, until the bug is fixed upstream and Arch picks it up in their official kernel, I have my &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PKGBUILD&lt;/span&gt; file and sources in &lt;a href="https://github.com/jantman/arch-pkgbuilds/tree/master/linux-precision5530"&gt;my arch-pkgbuilds GitHub repo&lt;/a&gt; as well as (unsigned, sorry) compiled binary packages in my &lt;a href="http://archrepo.jasonantman.com/current/index.html"&gt;arch packages repo (index page)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="arch"></category><category term="linux"></category><category term="dell"></category><category term="precision"></category><category term="xps"></category><category term="i915"></category><category term="nvidia"></category><category term="video"></category><category term="graphics"></category><category term="install"></category><category term="laptop"></category></entry><entry><title>Fedora Linux and OSX Dual Boot on Mid-2010 (6,2) 15” MacBook Pro Laptop</title><link href="https://blog.jasonantman.com/2013/01/fedora-linux-and-osx-dual-boot-on-mid-2010-62-15-macbook-pro-laptop/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-01-21T12:13:00-05:00</published><updated>2013-01-21T12:13:00-05:00</updated><author><name>admin</name></author><id>tag:blog.jasonantman.com,2013-01-21:/2013/01/fedora-linux-and-osx-dual-boot-on-mid-2010-62-15-macbook-pro-laptop/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;As part of the transition from a contractor to a full-time employee of

currently running &lt;a href="http://fedoraproject.org/"&gt;Fedora&lt;/a&gt; 17, dual-boot with
with Mac &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OS&lt;/span&gt; X (left in place for firmware updates and emergencies) using
the &lt;a href="http://www.rodsbooks.com/refind/index.html"&gt;rEFInd boot manager&lt;/a&gt; to
choose between the two OSes. It took me two days to get this working
right on my desktop, but it had been my plan to duplicate this setup on
my laptop. I found a lot of conflicting information online, but I
decided to give it a&amp;nbsp;try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I have Fedora 18 and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OS&lt;/span&gt; X 10.8 dual-booting on the laptop, but not
as planned. After a day and a half of research, troubleshooting and
re-installs, here&amp;#8217;s what I found to actually work, in the hope that
nobody else will go through the ordeal I went through. Following that
are some notes about the new Fedora 18 installer (Anaconda 18),
especially important for anyone who&amp;#8217;s used Linux for a while. To those
who are new to Linux, don&amp;#8217;t be dissuaded by the above. Most of the
frustration I experienced is because I&amp;#8217;ve been using Linux for a
relatively long time (about 10 years), had my own ideas about exactly
how I wanted things setup (which are decidedly &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; supported by
Fedora), and had some assumptions about the installation process based
on earlier&amp;nbsp;versions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to get it&amp;nbsp;working:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forget about rEFInd. This had been the original advice from &lt;a href="http://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/"&gt;Matthew
Garrett&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mjg59"&gt;@mjg59&lt;/a&gt;, kernel coder, contributor to the
Anaconda project, and all-around authority on booting Linux on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EFI&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;UEFI&lt;/span&gt;
hardware. My advice, and the method that worked for&amp;nbsp;me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shrink your Mac partitions and leave as much free space as you want
    for Fedora. using the Disk Utility tool in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OS&lt;/span&gt; X (I also created an
    &lt;span class="caps"&gt;8GB&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VFAT&lt;/span&gt; partition that both OSes can read/write&amp;nbsp;to).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://fedoraproject.org/en/get-fedora"&gt;Download Fedora 18&lt;/a&gt; 64-bit
    &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DVD&lt;/span&gt; image, I chose the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;KDE&lt;/span&gt; version. Verify the sha256 sum if you
    want (they don&amp;#8217;t have a readily visible link to the checksum file.
    Copy the download link, paste it into your address bar and remove
    the filename. You should get a directory index that includes a
    &lt;code&gt;-CHECKSUM&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Per the Installation Guide&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href="http://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/Fedora/18/html/Installation_Guide/Making_USB_Media-UNIX_Linux.html"&gt;Making Fedora &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USB&lt;/span&gt; Media
    page&lt;/a&gt;,
    use &lt;code&gt;liveusb-creator&lt;/code&gt; to setup the installation image on the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USB&lt;/span&gt;
    flash drive (I needed to start it with the &lt;code&gt;--reset-mbr&lt;/code&gt; option).
    You can also use other tools (dd if you&amp;#8217;re not on a Fedora-based
    distro), or a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DVD&lt;/span&gt;, but this is the method I&amp;nbsp;chose.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Due to a &lt;a href="https://fedorahosted.org/liveusb-creator/ticket/810"&gt;bug in
    liveusb-creator&lt;/a&gt;,
    you may need to manually edit &lt;code&gt;/EFI/boot/grub.cfg&lt;/code&gt; on the created
    &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USB&lt;/span&gt; stick if grub gives you a file not found error. If that happens,
    please see my bug report above for the action to take (in short, you
    need to mount the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USB&lt;/span&gt; stick, &lt;code&gt;chmod u+w /EFI/boot/grub.cfg&lt;/code&gt; then
    edit that file and replace every occurrence of &amp;#8220;isolinux&amp;#8221; with
    &amp;#8220;syslinux&amp;#8221; and every occurrence of
    &amp;#8220;root=live:&lt;span class="caps"&gt;LABEL&lt;/span&gt;=Fedora-18-x86_64-Live-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;KDE&lt;/span&gt;.iso&amp;#8221; with&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8220;root=live:&lt;span class="caps"&gt;LABEL&lt;/span&gt;=&lt;span class="caps"&gt;LIVE&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8221;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Boot the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USB&lt;/span&gt; drive (use the alt key when you turn on the laptop to
    select the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USB&lt;/span&gt; drive) and just install Fedora normally, letting it
    do its thing. Select a boot disk and let it put &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GRUB2&lt;/span&gt; on the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EFI&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;partition.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you boot, it will boot to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GRUB&lt;/span&gt;. There will be some options for Mac
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;OS&lt;/span&gt; there, but they don&amp;#8217;t work (more on that below). If you want to boot
Mac, hold down the alt/option key when you power on the laptop, which
will bring you to the boot disk selector and you can pick the Mac disk.
I know it&amp;#8217;s not pretty or ideal, but it&amp;#8217;s the best option right&amp;nbsp;now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Making it&amp;nbsp;Better:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GRUB2&lt;/span&gt; tries to automatically detect other OSes and configure them in the
boot loader (this is done through &lt;code&gt;/etc/grub.d/30_os-prober&lt;/code&gt;, commonly
just referred to as &lt;code&gt;os-prober&lt;/code&gt;). It tries to boot Mac directly through
the xnu_kernel64 module, which not only isn&amp;#8217;t installed on the boot
partition by default, but just doesn&amp;#8217;t work with at least Mountain Lion
(10.8). So getting &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GRUB&lt;/span&gt; to boot Mac means either having the bugs in the
xnu module fixed, or figuring out how to setup a chainloader to boot
from &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GRUB&lt;/span&gt; to Mac. The latter is probably the method I&amp;#8217;ll investigate,
but for now, since I rarely use Mac, I&amp;#8217;m happy having to use the alt key
at boot to get there. To remove the annoying, broken Mac &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OS&lt;/span&gt; options from
the grub screen, run the following commands as root (they assume you
have your &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EFI&lt;/span&gt; partition mounted at &lt;code&gt;/boot/efi&lt;/code&gt; which I believe Fedora
should do by&amp;nbsp;default:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;cp /boot/efi/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;EFI&lt;/span&gt;/fedora/grub.cfg /boot/efi/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;EFI&lt;/span&gt;/fedora/grub.cfg.bak
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;GRUB_DISABLE_OS_PROBER=&amp;quot;true&amp;quot;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;gt;&amp;gt; /etc/default/grub
grub2-mkconfig &amp;gt; /boot/efi/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;EFI&lt;/span&gt;/fedora/grub.cfg
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thoughts on the Fedora 18 Anaconda&amp;nbsp;Installer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found a couple of issues with the new Anaconda 18 installer that were
either unweildy or confusing for someone who&amp;#8217;s been installing Linux for
a long time. Overall, the new installer is very nice. It has a clean,
even elegant &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UI&lt;/span&gt;, a relatively nice flow from start to completion, and is
certainly beginner-friendly. It has fewer options than any Linux
installer I&amp;#8217;ve ever used before - not even options for package
selection, firewall or SELinux configuration, etc. - but I guess this is
in line with the goal of making Fedora a desktop &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OS&lt;/span&gt; for the masses. I
would have appreciated an &amp;#8220;advanced mode&amp;#8221; installer that was more like
Fedora 17 (or even much older versions), but I guess I&amp;#8217;m an edge case,
at least in the Fedora community. However, I did find two things
especially difficult, both related to the fact that my laptop has two
main drives (a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;500GB&lt;/span&gt; hard drive and a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;120GB&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SSD&lt;/span&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, the installer prompted me to select a &amp;#8220;boot disk&amp;#8221;. I guess I
should have read the installation guide, but I assumed that nomenclature
translated to either &amp;#8220;which disk should the automatic partitiioning put
yout &lt;code&gt;/boot&lt;/code&gt; partition on&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;which disk should I set the bootable flag
on in the partition table&amp;#8221;. In fact, it means &amp;#8220;which disk should I put
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GRUB&lt;/span&gt; on the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EFI&lt;/span&gt; partition of&amp;#8221;. I installed, rebooted, and was shocked -
and somewhat distressed - to boot directly to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GRUB2&lt;/span&gt; instead of the
rEFInd installation I had setup. The installer didn&amp;#8217;t have any of the
previously-customary &amp;#8220;warning: this will overwrite your &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MBR&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;EFI&lt;/span&gt; boot
partition&amp;#8221; notices, so I felt safe letting it continue. It turned out
that this was the way I ended up going, and it also turns out that
there&amp;#8217;s a bug in Anaconda that makes it fail installation if you tell it
not to write a bootloader to disk (though it&amp;#8217;s patched by one line of
Python code). But I was deeply distressed that - contrary to the
experience of every, admittedly more complicated, Linux installer I&amp;#8217;d
used before - the Fedora 18 installer overwrote my &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EFI&lt;/span&gt; bootloader
(analogous to overwriting the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MBR&lt;/span&gt; on a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BIOS&lt;/span&gt; boot machine) without ever
warning me or asking for a&amp;nbsp;confirmation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, the partitioning tool is clearly designed for only one
destination disk. The overview screen lists configured partitions by
label and mount point, but not by physical device, so figuring out which
partitions are on which physical disks takes a click on each and every
partition to view that information in the detail panel. When you create
a new partition, it&amp;#8217;s automatically put in a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LVM&lt;/span&gt; volume group spanning
all disks. Changing the target of the automatically created volume group
requires a few clicks, as does changing the physical disks backing any
new volume groups. To assign a newly created partition to a specific
disk, you have to click on an unlabeled &amp;#8220;tool&amp;#8221; icon under the list of
partitions, far away from the information on the partition in question.
It&amp;#8217;s a nice interface for someone who clicks the &amp;#8220;partition
automatically&amp;#8221; button, or who just knows they want to add &amp;#8220;an extra
partition&amp;#8221;, but for anyone who has a specific layout in mind (like
having &lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;/boot&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;/var&lt;/code&gt;, specifically sized, on the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SSD&lt;/span&gt; and
&lt;code&gt;/home&lt;/code&gt; on the rotating disk) it takes about 4-5 more clicks and dialogs
to add a partition than the last Fedora installer did. Mainly, it&amp;#8217;s
lacking any sort of Advanced Mode for partitioning that allows the user
to quickly and accurately layout a more complex partitioning&amp;nbsp;scheme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below are some screenshots from the Fedora 17 and Fedora 18 Installation
Guides, which contrast both the overview of all partitions and the
individual partition&amp;nbsp;settings:&lt;/p&gt;

part-timer, this Monday I start my full-time position at Rutgers as a
Linux SysAdmin. Not really anything different - same office, same work,
just another day a week and a pay bump (plus benefits and all that). My
only real change on the first day will be a 3-hour &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HR&lt;/span&gt; orientation and
moving my workstation to public address space. But, on the positive
side, my new laptop just came in - a shiny new 13&amp;#8221; MacBook Pro, 2.4GHz
Core2 Duo, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;4GB&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RAM&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;250GB&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HDD&lt;/span&gt;. Every time I see Mac packaging, I
remember why they cost so much - the box must be half the&amp;nbsp;price!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="MacBook Pro" src="/GFX/newMacBookPro.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If all goes well, I&amp;#8217;ll have the machine setup to dual-boot &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OSX&lt;/span&gt; and Linux
(specifically &lt;a href="http://www.opensuse.org"&gt;OpenSuSE&lt;/a&gt; 11.2. I&amp;#8217;ll post notes
when I have it&amp;nbsp;done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The list of things I have to figure out beyond just getting both OSes&amp;nbsp;running:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do I want to use Mac for more than a select few apps that require it
    (i.e. possibly as another day-to-day &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OS&lt;/span&gt;)? If so, I need to figure
    out file sharing between the OSes, what I want unified from my
    profiles/homedirs, Firefox profile sharing,&amp;nbsp;etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to do a simple shared&amp;nbsp;partition?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;FUSE&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SSHFS&lt;/span&gt; on the Mac&amp;nbsp;side.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is there a way to select the boot &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OS&lt;/span&gt; (rEFIt) from&amp;nbsp;Linux?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
