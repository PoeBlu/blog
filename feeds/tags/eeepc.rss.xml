Reader&lt;/a&gt; account, there&amp;#8217;s news about another
company that released a knock-off of my beloved &lt;a href="http://eeepc.asus.com/global/700.htm"&gt;Asus eeePC 4G Surf
(701)&lt;/a&gt; (interestingly, it looks
like eeepc.asus.com is down at the moment of writing). Even Asus has
released numerous (I think the product like is now up to about 10
variations) follow-ups to the 7&amp;#8221; beauty, now up to 10&amp;#8221; in size (though,
admittedly, I&amp;#8217;m less-than-enthused about their Windows&amp;nbsp;models).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the new semester here, I am (unfortunately) back in class. And I&amp;#8217;m
very happy to report that I&amp;#8217;m starting to see eeePCs in more and more
hands. Granted, my classes are in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IT&lt;/span&gt; program, but I was quite
surprised last night to be sitting in my Internet Security class and
notice no less than four eeePCs in a class of about 25 people. While
I&amp;#8217;ve just relegated my own 4G to my server room bag, replacing it with a
(used, surplus from work) &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IBM&lt;/span&gt; ThinkPad T41 (14.1&amp;#8221; display, 1.4GHz
Pentium, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;768MB&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RAM&lt;/span&gt;, and a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DVD&lt;/span&gt; drive). Though my heart sank when I found
that half of the eeePCs were running Windows, it seems that in my
travels around campus, I&amp;#8217;m seeing more and more eeePCs, and more laptops
running&amp;nbsp;Linux.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the academic world has surely embraced new technologies, and
non-mainstream technologies, quicker than other sectors (specifically
considering Linux and the apparent popularity of the eeePC), it&amp;#8217;s
definitely a good omen. Seeing non-geek, and perhaps even non-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CS&lt;/span&gt; and
non-Engineering, students using Linux speaks quite well for the
expansion of the Linux user base when these students graduate and enter
the &amp;#8220;real&amp;nbsp;world&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">admin</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 10 Sep 2008 23:55:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:blog.jasonantman.com,2008-09-10:2008/09/eeepc-stronger-than-ever/</guid><category>asus</category><category>eeepc</category><category>linux</category></item><item><title>Madwifi on the eeePC</title><link>http://blog.jasonantman.com/2008/05/madwifi-on-the-eeepc/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;So, I&amp;#8217;ve started a new &lt;a href="http://www.opensuse.org"&gt;OpenSuSE&lt;/a&gt; install on my
eeePC. The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;4GB&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SDHC&lt;/span&gt; card that I originally used was getting a bit
cramped - I couldn&amp;#8217;t even fit the kernel source! So, I bought a new &lt;span class="caps"&gt;8GB&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SDHC&lt;/span&gt; card and started from scratch. I know that OpenSuSE 11 is coming up
soon, but I just couldn&amp;#8217;t wait, so I just used OpenSuSE 10.3&amp;nbsp;again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I followed my &lt;a href="http://www.jasonantman.com/wiki/index.php/OpenSuSE_10.3_on_eeePC_External_SDHC"&gt;previous
how-to&lt;/a&gt;,
and also am updating it with some new information - such as my
xorg.conf. Most interestingly, though, I actually got MadWiFi to work
with the &lt;a href="http://madwifi.org/wiki/Compatibility/Atheros#AtherosAR5BXB63"&gt;Atheros
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AR5BXB63&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
on the eeePC! I haven&amp;#8217;t tested everything yet (specifically &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WPA&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;WPA2&lt;/span&gt;)
but it seems to work fine. I&amp;#8217;ve updated &lt;a href="http://www.jasonantman.com/wiki/index.php/OpenSuSE_10.3_on_eeePC_External_SDHC#Update_2008-05-02"&gt;my
HowTo&lt;/a&gt;
with the instructions, but mainly it hinges on using
madwifi-ng-r2756+ar5007 (&lt;a href="http://snapshots.madwifi.org/special/madwifi-ng-r2756+ar5007.tar.gz"&gt;gzipped
tarball&lt;/a&gt;)
and compiling from&amp;nbsp;source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; This HowTo is based on the original eeePC 701 4G and OpenSuSE
10.3. It may not be needed for newer versions of OpenSuSE or newer
versions of the&amp;nbsp;eeePC.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">admin</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 04 May 2008 22:32:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:blog.jasonantman.com,2008-05-04:2008/05/madwifi-on-the-eeepc/</guid><category>atheros</category><category>eeepc</category><category>madwifi</category><category>wifi</category><category>wireless</category></item><item><title>Asus eeePC Update</title><link>http://blog.jasonantman.com/2008/02/asus-eeepc-update/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;More to come sometime this week, when I have enough sanity and time to&amp;nbsp;write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the mean&amp;nbsp;time&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it&amp;#8217;s been two weeks since classes started again, and that means two
weeks using my now-beloved eeePC 4G Surf (details in a &lt;a href="/2008/01/eeepc-solaris-other-updates.html"&gt;previous
post&lt;/a&gt;).
Granted, I have my &amp;#8220;desktop replacement&amp;#8221; laptop (&lt;a href="http://www.linuxcertified.com/linux-laptop-lc2464.html"&gt;a Linux Certified
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;LC2464&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) to use
at my desk at home or at my apartment - though the &amp;#8220;desktop replacement&amp;#8221;
really means that it&amp;#8217;s easy to move from one desk to&amp;nbsp;another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, I really love it, but I have a few&amp;nbsp;issues:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I should have bought an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;8GB&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SDHC&lt;/span&gt; card instead of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;4GB&lt;/span&gt; that I got&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;especially with a full install of OpenSuSE with Sun&amp;#8217;s &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JDK&lt;/span&gt; and
OpenOffice, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;2GB&lt;/span&gt; root partition is 99%&amp;nbsp;full!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After using a desktop for hours, it takes a few lines of text for my
    fingers to re-adjust to the small keyboard. Hopefully it&amp;#8217;ll get
    easier with&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unfortunately, I don&amp;#8217;t have space for kernel headers or source, so I
    can&amp;#8217;t compile the customized version of asus_acpi. I can&amp;#8217;t find any
    binary packges, or binary kernel modules for my kernel version. That
    prevents me from using sleep/hibernate/suspend, and also means I
    don&amp;#8217;t get accurate battery calculations. I&amp;#8217;ve found from usage that
    the battery lasts 2-3 hours with wireless on and minimal screen
    brightness. Also, unfortunately, (maybe because of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ACPI&lt;/span&gt; issue?)
    if I dim the screen and then the screensaver comes on, when I log
    back in it resets to full&amp;nbsp;brightness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As of this week, there&amp;#8217;s still no MadWifi driver for the Atheros
    card in the 4G. I have to run it under Ndiswrapper. As a result, I
    can&amp;#8217;t get monitor mode, so the eee is effectively useless for
    wireless site surveys and security work. There&amp;#8217;s talk of a
    forthcoming MadWifi, but if nothing shows up, I may have to go with
    a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USB&lt;/span&gt; adapter (I don&amp;#8217;t want to void the warranty by swapping out the
    internal Mini-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PCI&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;adapter).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not a problem with the eeePC, but it seems like quite a few web
    sites that I&amp;#8217;ve visited are horribly coded - with static screen
    sizes assumed. On the small screen on the eee, the biggest issue is
    when the first few characters of every line on some sites are cut
    off, thereby rendering the content illegible. This is an issue out
    of Asus&amp;#8217; control, but can be a hindrance to full use. I have,
    however, found that for many sites, switching &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FF&lt;/span&gt; to &amp;#8220;full screen&amp;#8221;
    mode (F11)&amp;nbsp;helps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stay tuned for more, and some new scripts to automate wireless surveys,
rogue &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AP&lt;/span&gt; detection, etc. And maybe even some work with autonomics and or
configuration&amp;nbsp;tools.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">admin</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 04 Feb 2008 19:12:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>tag:blog.jasonantman.com,2008-02-04:2008/02/asus-eeepc-update/</guid><category>eeepc</category><category>linux</category></item></channel></rss>
