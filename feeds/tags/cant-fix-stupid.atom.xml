&lt;a href="http://www.mythtv.org"&gt;MythTV&lt;/a&gt; box, as I&amp;#8217;ve moved my beautiful Acer
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AL2416W&lt;/span&gt; 24&amp;#8221;er to my new desktop. The chosen monitor, based on price,
reviews and features, is the Acer X233Hbid. It&amp;#8217;s a 23&amp;#8221; 16:9 (not 16:10)
monitor that runs at 1920x1080, provides true 1080p, and has an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HDMI&lt;/span&gt;
input (not that I&amp;#8217;d ever use a
&lt;a href="http://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2007/01/hdcp-screwing-fans-more-ways-ever"&gt;restricted&lt;/a&gt;
connection). After a few minutes of having it turned on and running, the
picture quality is quite nice, even with quite a bit of&amp;nbsp;glare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I have two major complaints within the first ten minutes of
unboxing&amp;nbsp;it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No real manual, nor an online copy&lt;/strong&gt;. The monitor comes only with
    a Quick Start Guide. There&amp;#8217;s no printed full manual. More
    distressingly, it isn&amp;#8217;t even listed in their list of monitor models
    on their Support site. There&amp;#8217;s no manual copy online either. There
    was a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CD&lt;/span&gt; provided with the user&amp;#8217;s manual on it. However, for a
    company that sells netbooks with no &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CD&lt;/span&gt; drive, this seems like quite
    a bad decision. But why, you ask, would I need a manual for my&amp;nbsp;monitor?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VESA&lt;/span&gt; mounting instructions&lt;/strong&gt; One of my main criteria in
    choosing a monitor was that it allow
    &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VESA_mount"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;VESA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; mounting, as I have
    my MythTV monitor on a monitor arm (easily adjustable angle so
    others in the room can see). The Acer X233Hbid has a 100x100mm &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VESA&lt;/span&gt;
    mounting space on the back. However, in a rare design mistake
    (unlike my 24&amp;#8221; Acer &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AL2416W&lt;/span&gt;), the monitor stand is two parts - one
    rectangular column about 4&amp;#8221; long attached to the back of the
    monitor, and a base with a column which mates with the one on the
    back of the monitor. Unfortunately, the column part on the back of
    the monitor came pre-attached, and there was no mention in the
    manual of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VESA&lt;/span&gt; mounting or how to remove the&amp;nbsp;column.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Column removal:&lt;/strong&gt; The part of the monitor base which ships attached to
the monitor is a fairly easy removal. Though I was originally worried
about breaking something on my beautiful new screen, I found two plastic
pieces on either side of the pre-attached part of the base which
appeared to be snap-in trim pieces. Prying them off with a screwdriver
revealed four screws which hold this piece to the monitor. Not only was
removal easy, but the trim pieces snapped back into place for a nice
clean&amp;nbsp;look.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="acer"></category><category term="cant fix stupid"></category><category term="monitor"></category><category term="review"></category></entry></feed>
