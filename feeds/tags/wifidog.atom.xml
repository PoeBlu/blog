due to changing priorities, there are a lot of projects I&amp;#8217;ve been
working on, but few of them have gotten finished. A sampling, in no
specific&amp;nbsp;order:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Migrating my network/service monitoring to Nagios 3, &lt;em&gt;totally&lt;/em&gt;
    re-writing my config files to make use of the new features, and
    making one coherent list of all the services that should be in it
    and&amp;nbsp;aren&amp;#8217;t.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Planning to totally re-wire all networking at the &lt;a href="http://www.midlandparkambulance.com"&gt;ambulance corps
    building&lt;/a&gt; to eliminate some
    problems. This includes &lt;em&gt;building&lt;/em&gt; an 8U wall-mount rack, and also
    trying a &lt;a href="http://www.pcengines.ch/alix2c1.htm"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PC&lt;/span&gt; Engines &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ALIX&lt;/span&gt;.2c1&lt;/a&gt;
    board as a router (still undecided on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WAN&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;LAN&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DMZ&lt;/span&gt; or &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WAN&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;LAN&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;WLAN&lt;/span&gt;).
    It also means a long day of work at some point in the future, and
    lots of cable&amp;nbsp;drops.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://tuxostat.jasonantman.com"&gt;tuxOstat&lt;/a&gt;, the linux-controlled
    thermostat, is pretty much on the back burner. It&amp;#8217;s a stable beta
    with severely reduced functionality, but has been handling my
    cooling needs without any major bugs in the past month or so. It
    still only has a basic &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CLI&lt;/span&gt; interface and a very simple kludge of a
    web &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GUI&lt;/span&gt;, but it works. Other modes (heating, fan only), predictive
    temperature calculation, other temperature/zone calculation modes,
    and physical controls (buttons, menu on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LCD&lt;/span&gt;) are still to come, as
    well as the move from &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PC&lt;/span&gt; to Soekris (if I can ever figure it out,
    and get one with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USB&lt;/span&gt;). I now feel that an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ALIX&lt;/span&gt; board might be a
    better shot, as they take &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CF&lt;/span&gt; (more space than the Soekris), have a
    slightly faster processor, and also support &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USB&lt;/span&gt; at about half the
    price&amp;nbsp;point.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;#8217;m considering moving my main web site to a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CMS&lt;/span&gt;, and letting the
    &lt;a href="http://www.jasonantman.com/wiki/"&gt;wiki&lt;/a&gt; serve more as a knowledge&amp;nbsp;base.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;#8217;m working on patching together a new access point for the
    ambulance corps, based on &lt;a href="http://pyramid.metrix.net/"&gt;Pyramid
    Linux&lt;/a&gt;. I needed something which would
    run on the Soekris net4526, had at least &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WEP&lt;/span&gt;, and supported some
    sort of captive portal. Pyramid has
    &lt;a href="http://dev.wifidog.org/"&gt;WifiDog&lt;/a&gt;, but that only wants to do local
    authentication or &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RADIUS&lt;/span&gt;, and I wanted direct auth to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LDAP&lt;/span&gt; and MySQL
    logging. On the positive side, it just uses some &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt; pages hosted
    under Apache to handle authentication - the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WAP&lt;/span&gt; redirects the user
    to a login page on a (separate) web server, the user does their
    stuff, and then the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WAP&lt;/span&gt; makes a request to the server to determine
    whether it should open up the firewall, keep the user locked down,
    or totally kick them. So, once I figure out some routing issues,
    I&amp;#8217;ll get back to working on the new project -
    &lt;a href="http://blacklabauth.jasonantman.com/"&gt;BlackLabAuth&lt;/a&gt;, a re-write of
    the WifiDog auth server software that&amp;#8217;s geared towards a
    closed-access network (i.e. only people and/or MACs already listed
    in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LDAP&lt;/span&gt; can login) with full logging to MySQL. I already have some
    code &lt;a href="http://cvs.jasonantman.com/BlackLabAuth"&gt;in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CVS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but some
    issues with my development Soekris board have slowed the project for
    the time being. When finished, I&amp;#8217;ll have not only the new auth
    server available for download (with documentation) but also a
    ready-to-run (well, some configuration time needed, but minor and
    scripted) image for the&amp;nbsp;net4526.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My desktop that I use for &lt;a href="http://www.mythtv.org/"&gt;MythTV&lt;/a&gt; filled up
    its&amp;#8217; disk. Totally. I ordered a cheap Syba &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SATA&lt;/span&gt; card (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PCI&lt;/span&gt;) from
    NewEgg, along with a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;500GB&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WD&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SATA&lt;/span&gt;-150 disk, but no luck. Though the
    card (Syba / Initio 1622 chipset, shows up as Class 0106: 1101:1622
    (rev 02)) said it was supported under Linux, the driver &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CD&lt;/span&gt; mentioned
    nothing about it. Some investigation on the Syba website turned up a
    zipped archive. After extraction, I found a readme that gave (poor)
    instructions on how to re-compile a kernel, and warned that you &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MUST&lt;/span&gt;
    have 2.6.15. Oh well, I wasn&amp;#8217;t going to give up 2.6.16.27 (the
    newest &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RPM&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;d kernel for OpenSuSE 10.1). The standard drivers for it
    didn&amp;#8217;t appear until 2.6.25 or so. So&amp;#8230; after many debates with
    myself as to whether I should blow away my whole MythTV installation
    and upgrade from the now-ancient 10.1, I decided that I&amp;#8217;ll only be
    in my apartment for another year, I should make it last. Some
    investigation turned up a $24 Silicon Image-based card that should
    work fine, and it&amp;#8217;s now in the&amp;nbsp;mail&amp;#8230;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m sure I missed something big, but I&amp;#8217;ll update as needed, and attempt
to make it a daily habit to post something interesting or, at the very
least, hard-to-find. After all, I&amp;#8217;m sure that I use this blog and my
wiki as an informational resource (my bad memory) more than anyone else&amp;nbsp;would&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="access point"></category><category term="alix"></category><category term="BlackLabAuth"></category><category term="mythtv"></category><category term="Nagios"></category><category term="pc engines"></category><category term="soekris"></category><category term="tuxostat"></category><category term="WifiDog"></category><category term="wireless"></category></entry></feed>
