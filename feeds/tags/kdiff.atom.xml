subversion repo. The second started out as a &amp;#8220;development&amp;#8221; copy of the
first (without branching, unfortunately). Since there&amp;#8217;s quite a few
files, I decided that a graphical diff program is a must. I usually use
&lt;a href="http://kdiff3.sourceforge.net"&gt;kdiff3&lt;/a&gt;, but my requirements for this
are a bit more stringent than usual: it has to handle recursive diffs on
two directories, and it has to be able to ignore &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SVN&lt;/span&gt; keywords (or an
arbitrary regex) since all of the files have keyword substitution on
LastChangedRevision and HeadURL. Kdiff3 supports &lt;a href="http://kdiff3.sourceforge.net/doc/preprocessors.html"&gt;preprocessor
commands&lt;/a&gt; which
can include filtering the text through sed before performing the diff
(so I modified their regex to ignore version control keywords), but for
some reason (perhaps either bimary differences, or metadata differences)
I couldn&amp;#8217;t get the file difference indicator in the diretory tree view
to reflect this; even when ignoring keyword lines and whitespace, it
still showed every pair of files as&amp;nbsp;different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enter &lt;a href="http://meldmerge.org/"&gt;Meld&lt;/a&gt;, a graphical diff project. I&amp;#8217;ve only
used it for half an hour or so, but it seems wonderful. It&amp;#8217;s easy to
use, has a pleasing interface similar to
&lt;a href="http://www.caffeinated.me.uk/kompare/"&gt;Kompare&lt;/a&gt;, and even has simple
check boxes in the options menu to ignore whitespace and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SVN&lt;/span&gt; keywords -
and they work! So far, I&amp;#8217;m about half way through my 300+ file tree, and
the merge is going&amp;nbsp;wonderfully.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="diff"></category><category term="kde"></category><category term="kdiff"></category><category term="meld"></category><category term="merge"></category><category term="subversion"></category><category term="svn"></category></entry></feed>
