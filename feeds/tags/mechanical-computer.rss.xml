video&lt;/a&gt; shared on &lt;a href="http://everythingsysadmin.com/2012/10/mechanical-computer-instructio.html"&gt;Tom
Limoncelli&amp;#8217;s
blog&lt;/a&gt;.
It&amp;#8217;s a 1953 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; Navy instructional video about an all-mechanical fire
control computer. Yes, I really mean a &lt;em&gt;computer&lt;/em&gt; that can solve
continuously changing 25-variable fire control problems using only
mechanical means (gears, cams, etc.). Think about it for a minute - it&amp;#8217;s
truly mind-boggling. And really gives one an amazing appreciation for
the power of a simple pocket calculator, and the amazing engineering
that went into solving these problems before electronic computers. I&amp;#8217;m
usually not much of a math geek, but I watched the whole 40 minute video
and was in awe of both the simple ability to use three arms and a pin to
multiply numbers, and the amazingly precise engineering and machining it
would take to translate various rotation inputs into landing a shell on
a moving ship miles away. It&amp;#8217;s a really good watch, and will probably
leave you astonished by both how far technology has come (and what we
take for granted every day), and by the fact that feats of engineering
like this one worked quite&amp;nbsp;well.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">admin</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 12 Oct 2012 20:54:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:blog.jasonantman.com,2012-10-12:2012/10/all-mechanical-computer-instructional-video/</guid><category>mechanical computer</category></item></channel></rss>
