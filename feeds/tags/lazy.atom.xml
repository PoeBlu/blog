folder before deleting the contents (I used to just do this once a week
or so, but apparently since jasonantman.com is up and running correctly
and listening on port 25, the volume has increased a bit) and came by
this&amp;nbsp;email:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subject:
Dear $TO_EMAIL 17.3.2009 84% &lt;span class="caps"&gt;0FF&lt;/span&gt;
From: Best Price &amp;lt;$TO_EMAIL&amp;gt;
Date: Tue, 17 Mar 2009 16:45:54 -0400 (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;EDT&lt;/span&gt;)
To:&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;$TO_EMAIL&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow. I know that spammers aren&amp;#8217;t exactly world-class programmers, but
this seems like something that anyone who&amp;#8217;s been in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CS101&lt;/span&gt; would realize
is&amp;nbsp;wrong&amp;#8230;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the positive side, maybe I should just add a SpamAssassin rule to
trigger for anything with &amp;#8220;$TO_EMAIL&amp;#8221; in the headers. Not that I&amp;#8217;d need
it in this case, as the message had a score of 21.7 and my threshold is&amp;nbsp;5.0&amp;#8230;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="lazy"></category><category term="spam"></category></entry></feed>
