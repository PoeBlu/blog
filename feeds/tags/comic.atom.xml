&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blacklists, Blocking, Reverse-Validation&lt;/strong&gt; - Yes, they have some uses.
I use Daemon Synchronization in
&lt;a href="http://www.jasonantman.com/wiki/index.php/DenyHosts"&gt;DenyHosts&lt;/a&gt; and
plug-ins like Pyzor in SpamAssassin. However, I&amp;#8217;ve also been the victim
of blacklists, and the new Internet order, many times. There&amp;#8217;s a
conspiracy between ISPs - simply put, big ISPs want everyone else to use
big ISPs. I understand the logic behind reverse-validation. However, I
have a residential internet connection. I also run Linux. When I got
Verizon, I configured Postfix to deliver mail directly. Big mistake.
Most big email providers (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AOL&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MSN&lt;/span&gt;, probably Gmail too) will bounce back
e-mail that comes from a domain that doesn&amp;#8217;t reverse-validate. And since
Verizon owns my &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IP&lt;/span&gt;, despite the substantial sums of money they&amp;#8217;ve been
getting from me, my &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IP&lt;/span&gt; doesn&amp;#8217;t reverse-validate to my domain name. To
top it off, Verizon blocks the usual &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SMTP&lt;/span&gt; ports on residential
connections, so I can&amp;#8217;t have people send me e-mail either. Everything
needs to be relayed through Verizon. To add to the frustration, Verizon
blocks port 80 on my connection, so I&amp;#8217;m forced to serve my whole site on
an unused (and un-blocked) high-numbered port. And use
&lt;a href="http://www.dyndns.org"&gt;DynDNS.org&lt;/a&gt; to redirect to my dynamic &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IP&lt;/span&gt;. This
wouldn&amp;#8217;t be so much of an issue if I didn&amp;#8217;t know that some large
companies have firewalls configured to block &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTTP&lt;/span&gt; requests *&lt;span class="caps"&gt;OUT&lt;/span&gt;* to
any non-default port. As a result, my own father can&amp;#8217;t view my web site
or blog from work. What ever happened to the little&amp;nbsp;guy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Network Performance&lt;/strong&gt; - I know I have old computers and an old switch.
But there&amp;#8217;s something wrong when network file transfers crawl by at \~3
Mbps. I setup &lt;a href="http://sd.wareonearth.com/~phil/net/ttcp/"&gt;nttcp&lt;/a&gt; on two
of my machines to measure throughput, and was greeted with numbers in
the realm of 93-96 Mbps - what I&amp;#8217;d expect on a 100 Mpbs network.
However, a file transfer between these two machines barely scratched 8
Mpbs. Maybe GigE is the answer, but I&amp;#8217;ll be looking into the theory
behind this in the next few days - admittedly, I don&amp;#8217;t know much about
network performance, but I&amp;#8217;m willing to&amp;nbsp;learn&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Project&lt;/strong&gt; - I&amp;#8217;ve started planning on a new project,
&lt;a href="http://www.openepcr.org"&gt;openEPCR&lt;/a&gt;. My &lt;a href="http://www.php-ems-tools.com"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EMS&lt;/span&gt;
Tools&lt;/a&gt; package for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EMS&lt;/span&gt; and fire agencies
seems to be generating a lot of downloads (yet little community
interest), and I&amp;#8217;m now seriously thinking about the lack of a free,
open-source Electronic Patient Care Report package for the pre-hospital
care industry. A lot of these organizations are volunteer and operating
on limited budgets. Stay tuned&amp;#8230; all I&amp;#8217;ll say is that what I&amp;#8217;ve planned
is something that you&amp;#8217;d expect from me - open-source,
platform-independent, and geared towards limited hardware resources.
I&amp;#8217;ll probably be looking towards Java as a development platform, though
the interest generated in &lt;a href="http://gears.google.com/"&gt;Google Gears&lt;/a&gt; may
also pay off. Of course, there&amp;#8217;s no way I can do such an ambitious
project myself, so I&amp;#8217;m looking for developers to help&amp;nbsp;out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Comic&lt;/strong&gt; - pretty much the only non-serious content in my Google Reader
account is &lt;a href="http://xkcd.com"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;XKCD&lt;/span&gt;.com&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;#8217;s a great comic with
wonderful technical and geek humor. Today&amp;#8217;s
&lt;a href="http://xkcd.com/327/"&gt;comic&lt;/a&gt; was so good that I just had to include&amp;nbsp;it&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
