thought I&amp;#8217;d learn much in such a course at
&lt;a href="http://scils.rutgers.edu"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SCILS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but I&amp;#8217;d like to graduate on time, and
need the credits, and Bill Crosbie is just the type of rare teacher that
can keep even me awake and interested. Our book is &lt;a href="http://www.informit.com/store/product.aspx?isbn=0132239973"&gt;Practical &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt; and
MySQL: Building Eight Dynamic Web
Applications&lt;/a&gt;
(&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Practical-PHP-MySQL-Building-Applications/dp/0132239973"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;)
by &lt;a href="http://www.jonobacon.org/"&gt;Jono Bacon&lt;/a&gt;. Now, I know it&amp;#8217;s not a
&lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; book like, say, &lt;a href="http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596003432/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ESA3&lt;/span&gt; by
Frisch&lt;/a&gt;, which has a healthy
&lt;a href="http://www.aeleen.com/home.htm"&gt;web presense&lt;/a&gt;. But this thing is all
code and doesn&amp;#8217;t even have a web site, let alone easy code&amp;nbsp;downloads!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book does come with a heavily customized Ubuntu LiveCD. However,
when I popped it in my &lt;a href="http://www.opensuse.org"&gt;OpenSuSE workstation&lt;/a&gt;,
I couldn&amp;#8217;t really make much out of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CD&lt;/span&gt; - there was certainly no
easy-to-find &amp;#8220;this is the code&amp;#8221; directory. Well, after some exploring, I
mounted the &lt;a href="http://squashfs.sourceforge.net/"&gt;SquashFS&lt;/a&gt; filesystem and
poked around a bit. Strange&amp;#8230; seems to only have one real user (root)
and, though they claim this is a fully-functional &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LAMP&lt;/span&gt; server, no Apache
or MySQL. Really weird. Well, after poking for a few minutes, I found
the holy grail - &lt;code&gt;/root/.bash_history&lt;/code&gt; was intact! Just a quick look
through it with &lt;code&gt;less&lt;/code&gt; and I found what I was looking for: &lt;code&gt;/opt/lampp&lt;/code&gt;.
It appears that the install is actually ApacheFriends&amp;#8217;
&lt;a href="http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp-linux.html"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;LAMPP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;span class="caps"&gt;XAMPP&lt;/span&gt; for
Linux (gotta wonder if the guy writing this book doesn&amp;#8217;t even know how
to install Apache&amp;#8230; I&amp;#8217;m sure &lt;span class="caps"&gt;XAMPP&lt;/span&gt; for Linux is more bloated than a
customized build of Apache/MySQL/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt; from source, especially since it&amp;#8217;s
only being used to host 8 sample projects, so a lot could be left&amp;nbsp;out).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, it appears that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LAMPP&lt;/span&gt; is running in a chroot&amp;#8217;ed environment. The
actual sample code is rooted at &lt;code&gt;/opt/lampp/htdocs/sites&lt;/code&gt;. It seems that
&lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt; files are also owned by root and chmod&amp;#8217;ed 777! And
the top-level &lt;code&gt;index.php&lt;/code&gt; file makes use of absolute links, so obviously
he never thought that someone may want to copy the sample code and use
it on a &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just can&amp;#8217;t imagine someone who&amp;#8217;s a beginner with Linux, let alone a
Windows person, trying to get this source code onto a machine where they
can actually play with it. And&amp;#8230; to make the situation worse&amp;#8230; the
LiveCD has vi and vim, but no Emacs!!!!&amp;nbsp;Eeeek!!&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">admin</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 26 Jun 2008 14:29:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:blog.jasonantman.com,2008-06-26:2008/06/practical-php-and-mysql/</guid><category>books</category><category>linux</category><category>PHP</category><category>programming</category><category>rutgers</category></item><item><title>Update, Eventum/MySQLTicketing Integration</title><link>http://blog.jasonantman.com/2008/02/update-eventummysqlticketing-integration/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Well I know I haven&amp;#8217;t updated in a while. I have a whole bunch of links
that I&amp;#8217;d like to comment on, but things have been horribly busy. You can
find the links in my &lt;a href="http://del.icio.us/jantman/1-toblog"&gt;&amp;#8220;1-toblog&amp;#8221; folder on
del.icio.us&lt;/a&gt; (prefixed with &amp;#8220;1-&amp;#8221; so
it shows up at the beginning of my bookmark&amp;nbsp;menu).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In monitoring land, I&amp;#8217;ve paused my &lt;a href="http://www.hyperic.com/products/hq_oss.html"&gt;Hyperic
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;HQ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VM&lt;/span&gt; as I wasn&amp;#8217;t too
pleased with how the features panned out. I was invited to beta test
&lt;a href="http://www.groundworkopensource.com/"&gt;Groundwork Open Source&lt;/a&gt; 5.2b, but
I&amp;#8217;m not crazy about the open-ness of a non-public Beta, and am honestly
not that intrigued by the small feature set (though, admittedly, they do
need more documentation on the F/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;OSS&lt;/span&gt; version). I&amp;#8217;d still like to try
them all, especially &lt;a href="http://www.zenoss.com/product/core"&gt;Zenoss Core&lt;/a&gt;,
but I&amp;#8217;m pretty busy with class, and things are heating up at work and
with a few consulting&amp;nbsp;projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my &amp;#8220;spare time&amp;#8221; (read: staying up until 5 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AM&lt;/span&gt; and somehow still
getting up for work at 9) I&amp;#8217;ve been working on something that&amp;#8217;s been
bugging me for a while - getting &lt;a href="http://www.nagios.org/"&gt;Nagios&lt;/a&gt; to
automatically open and update tickets in
&lt;a href="http://eventum.mysql.org"&gt;Eventum&lt;/a&gt;, the ticketing system that I (and
MySQL) use. The general idea is to use a &amp;#8220;glue&amp;#8221; script, written in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt;
(Eventum&amp;#8217;s native language). It will (hopefully) keep track of which
hosts/services it has opened tickets for (and what the ticket &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ID&lt;/span&gt; is),
and decide from that whether to open a new ticket or, if one already
exists for that host/service, update it. It should also handle changes
to assigned user/group, update categories, priorities, etc. This will
all be based on a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DB&lt;/span&gt; table that maps problem severities and
hosts/services to the users, groups, categories, and priorities that
they should be&amp;nbsp;assigned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest problem is that I&amp;#8217;m not a whiz at object-oriented &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt;, and
like any good &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OO&lt;/span&gt; program, Eventum is broken down into dozens of objects,
classes, and files. With the help of the &lt;a href="http://xdebug.org/"&gt;Xdebug debugging extension for
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which prints full debugging output including
stack and function call traces, I&amp;#8217;ve been able to *finally* - after
about four hours of work - write a simple little 15-line script that
uses &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ONLY&lt;/span&gt; existing Eventum classes, unmodified (except for a separate
init.php with some stuff commented out), which gets a list of users
assigned to an issue. From here, it shouldn&amp;#8217;t be difficult to get full
issue information and then, hopefully, add and update&amp;nbsp;issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a &lt;a href="http://www.jasonantman.com/wiki/index.php/Monitoring_Ticketing"&gt;basic description of the project on my
wiki&lt;/a&gt;,
and the current (development, so could be broken) source code in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CVS&lt;/span&gt;,
which can be &lt;a href="http://cvs.jasonantman.com/cvs/Eventum-Nagios/"&gt;seen through ViewVC on my
site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stay&amp;nbsp;Tuned!&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">admin</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 21 Feb 2008 14:53:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>tag:blog.jasonantman.com,2008-02-21:2008/02/update-eventummysqlticketing-integration/</guid><category>eventum</category><category>monitoring</category><category>mysql</category><category>programming</category><category>ticketing</category></item><item><title>Poor PHP</title><link>http://blog.jasonantman.com/2007/03/poor-php/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Well, as mentioned below, today I was doing a little research. On the
futility of a Computer Science major. Specifically, on the fact that the
overwhelming odds are that in a career in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IT&lt;/span&gt;, system administration, or
even web programming, I&amp;#8217;ll probably never apply 90% of what I learn in
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CS&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;courses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I went looking for online certificate programs, knowing that most of
the vendors&amp;#8217; programs run $500 or more just for testing. I came by
eCertificates.com. And this brings me to another topic&amp;#8230; I clicked on
the &amp;#8220;Software Programming&amp;#8221; category, and was surprised to see no &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt;
test. On a hunch, I looked under &amp;#8220;Web Design&amp;#8221;, and sure enough, there it&amp;nbsp;was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know this is a common misconception, and I know that because it plays
so well with the web, and Apache, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt; has been pigeonholed as a web
language. Maybe I&amp;#8217;m just crazy, or maybe it&amp;#8217;s just because I know &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt;
better than anything else. But &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt; is &lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NOT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; a web programming language.
It is a programming language that happens to work &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; well with web&amp;nbsp;applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using &lt;code&gt;fread()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;fwrite()&lt;/code&gt; I can slam together a command-line menu-based
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt; script for administration quicker than I could write the def&amp;#8217;s for a
Python script. I&amp;#8217;ve done it, I have a number of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CLI&lt;/span&gt;-based scripts
running on my machines. Database access with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt; is a no-brainer. And
one day, when I get around to reading my &amp;#8220;ancient&amp;#8221; pile of books and
learning NCurses, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt; will be right there with&amp;nbsp;me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I guess it is just a fact of the modern web mentality. But &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt; has
myriad uses aside from web applications and web content handling. Sure,
my web site is written in it. But one of my backup scripts is, too. And
more importantly, if I&amp;#8217;m working with a database that already has a
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt;-based web frontend, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt; seems like the natural choice for a
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CLI&lt;/span&gt;-based administration&amp;nbsp;backend.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">admin</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 21 Mar 2007 16:42:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:blog.jasonantman.com,2007-03-21:2007/03/poor-php/</guid><category>command line</category><category>computer science</category><category>PHP</category><category>programming</category><category>web programming</category></item></channel></rss>
