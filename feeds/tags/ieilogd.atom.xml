&lt;p&gt;tuxOstat, my thermostat project, isn&amp;#8217;t totally finished, but is up
and running. There&amp;#8217;s still some work to do, but the code is largely
complete. There&amp;#8217;s
also a web interface with temperature
graphs, system status, and a (horrible) webcam view of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LCD&lt;/span&gt; control
panel. I&amp;#8217;ll probably be finishing up a first version this week,
finishing the documentation next week, and releasing what I have&amp;nbsp;soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got an e-mail today about one of my older projects, &lt;a href="http://www.php-ems-tools.com"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EMS&lt;/span&gt;
Tools&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt;/MySQL based application for
fire/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;EMS&lt;/span&gt; agencies to handle scheduling, membership rosters, equipment
checks, etc. The potential user was asking about running the software on
Windows - which, of course, I have no experience with. I&amp;#8217;m pretty sure
there aren&amp;#8217;t many, if any, Unix-specific calls hidden in the code, and
advised him to try &lt;span class="caps"&gt;XAMPP&lt;/span&gt; (Apache/MySQL on Windows). But I did take a
moment to comment on why I chose Linux. My pilot installation of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EMS&lt;/span&gt;
Tools, at the Midland Park Volunteer Ambulance Corps, where I&amp;#8217;ve been a
member since 2005, has been handling our scheduling, roster, and
equipment checks since June 2006. It&amp;#8217;s running on a generation 1 Compaq
Proliant &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DL380&lt;/span&gt;, running dual Pentium &lt;span class="caps"&gt;III&lt;/span&gt; 733MHz processors and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;1GB&lt;/span&gt;
memory - and even with a number of other programs on it, including
ieilogd which is reading from the
serial port 24x7 - the load average has never passed 1.2 and the memory
usage is well under 50%. More importantly, the system has been up for
442 days without a&amp;nbsp;hiccup!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="ieilogd"></category><category term="linux"></category><category term="php ems tools"></category><category term="tuxostat"></category></entry></feed>
