give a recap of what&amp;#8217;s going on. I went down to Mount Holly, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NJ&lt;/span&gt;
yestserday morning - about a 2-/12 hour drive each way, and picked up a
41U rack for the basement. Pretty damn heavy, took me two hours to
disassemble it, wrangle it down the stairs, and get it back together.
It&amp;#8217;s an old round-hole rack, which didn&amp;#8217;t seem to matter much until I
found that the tabs of the Dell Rapid Rails are just a bit too big to
fit in it, so neither my rack &lt;span class="caps"&gt;KMM&lt;/span&gt; nor the rails for my mail server will
fit. A bigger problem, though, is that the guy told me it was the
standard &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HP&lt;/span&gt; 29&amp;#8221; deep, and I found it to be 28-1/4&amp;#8221; deep when I started
racking things up. So, though I just spent $200 on rails for old
Proliants, they&amp;#8217;re all about 1/2&amp;#8221; too long to&amp;nbsp;fit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, I also had Cablevision show up to install the new Optimum
Business with 5 static&amp;nbsp;IPs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, last night around 9:00, I started the arduous task of (for the first
time ever) powering down &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ALL&lt;/span&gt; of my machines, moving them to the new
rack, and re-cabling. That took about 2-1/2 hours, after which my intent
was to bring up the new Optimum connection, configure the Vyatta router,
and roll over mail and web. From what I&amp;#8217;d read of the Vyatta docs it
seemed a relatively straightforward task, and being the stubborn jackass
that I am, I decied, &amp;#8220;hey, it&amp;#8217;s my personal site, it&amp;#8217;s low traffic, and
I want it up before I go to sleep. I&amp;#8217;ll roll over &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DNS&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; I bring
everything&amp;nbsp;up.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was a &lt;strong&gt;very bad idea&lt;/strong&gt;. Vyatta isn&amp;#8217;t nearly as
simple as it seems - especially for someone who isn&amp;#8217;t really a network
(or at least router/firewall) guy. When they say Enterprise, they mean
robust. They also mean that week-long bootcamps aren&amp;#8217;t for naught. It
took me about half an hour to figure out that even if no &amp;#8220;firewall&amp;#8221;
ruleset is associated with an interface, it still has an implicit drop
all. And if you only want to firewall what&amp;#8217;s coming in from the outside
world, and let everything out, you need to add explicit allow all rules
to the in and out sides of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LAN&lt;/span&gt; inteface and the out side of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WAN&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To top all this off, I had some serious still-unexplained &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DHCP&lt;/span&gt; problems
on the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LAN&lt;/span&gt;, a serious issue since I just set all my hosts to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DHCP&lt;/span&gt; (which
I&amp;#8217;ll probably undo soon). So, Yesterday was network work from 7:30 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AM&lt;/span&gt; to
3 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AM&lt;/span&gt; today (including driving to pickup the rack). By the time 3 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AM&lt;/span&gt;
rolled around, I was quite unhappy that I decided to roll over &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DNS&lt;/span&gt; in
order to force myself to get things working, as I ended up going back to
FiOS for client access only. Today started around 10 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AM&lt;/span&gt;, and here I am -
6:30 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PM&lt;/span&gt;, and I just got things working partially right. I have mail
working - arguably the most important - for jasonantman.com only, though
I have yet to setup any&amp;nbsp;aliases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the web side, I&amp;#8217;m working to setup name-based vhosts for all of the
subdomains, but for some reason, blog is showing up for everything.
Luckily it works right. So we&amp;#8217;ll&amp;nbsp;see&amp;#8230;.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">admin</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 07 Mar 2009 19:05:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>tag:blog.jasonantman.com,2009-03-07:2009/03/many-many-changes/</guid><category>firewall</category><category>optimum</category><category>rack</category><category>router</category><category>wan</category></item><item><title>Big Changes to JasonAntman.com</title><link>http://blog.jasonantman.com/2009/03/big-changes-to-jasonantmancom/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Well, I finally broke down and ordered Optimum Business. Come tomorrow,
I&amp;#8217;ll be moving from Verizon FiOS residential with a dynamic &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IP&lt;/span&gt;, much
blocked (hence jantman.dyndns.org:10011) and 10Mbps down/2Mbps up to
Optimum Business with 30 down/5 up, a block of 5 static IPs, and no
blocked&amp;nbsp;ports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s going to be a crazy weekend. Probably not the best thing the week
before midterms, but oh well. Tomorrow morning I&amp;#8217;m picking up a 42U rack
for home to replace the Sears shelving unit my boxes are currently on.
Cablevision is supposed to be here between 2-5 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PM&lt;/span&gt; to do the install
(yes, they insist that for Business they do the install, even though
it&amp;#8217;s only a 4-foot coax run from the first splitter to the demarc). I&amp;#8217;ve
got &lt;a href="http://www.vyatta.org"&gt;Vyatta&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CE5&lt;/span&gt; Beta installed on a &lt;a href="http://h18000.www1.hp.com/products/quickspecs/11049_na/11049_na.HTML"&gt;Proliant
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DL360G2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
as the new router, ready to go (after some configuration). I&amp;#8217;ll probably
keep FiOS up until I know the new router is working correctly (I&amp;#8217;ll do a
test on my management&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;VLAN&lt;/span&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once Optimum and the new router is up, the fun&amp;nbsp;starts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Forward the appropriate ports on the new router, including 80 (in
    addition to&amp;nbsp;10011).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bring the old router down and make sure the new one is up,
    operational, and forwarding all the right&amp;nbsp;ports.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Update DynDNS to point to the first &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IP&lt;/span&gt;, used as a catch-all for old
    DynDNS&amp;nbsp;links.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Begin assignment of the 5 IPs (everything will be behind &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NAT&lt;/span&gt;) based
    on a list of what hosts need valid reverse &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DNS&lt;/span&gt;, and then adding
    other ports (NATed) as&amp;nbsp;needed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Update &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DNS&lt;/span&gt; for JasonAntman.com and the other&amp;nbsp;domains.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Update Optimum reverse&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DNS&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ensure that everything works as planned, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DNS&lt;/span&gt; is up, ports are
    forwarded, and everything is as before (at least in terms of&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTTP&lt;/span&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DNS&lt;/span&gt; is up, reconfigure Apache to have a vhost handling any
    legacy requests to port 10011 and rewrite them to&amp;nbsp;www.jasonantman.com.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Setup a vhost for &amp;#8216;www&amp;#8217; that takes URLs that used to be
    subdirectories (i.e. www.jasonantman.com/blog) and rewrites them to
    requests for the appropriate subdomain. Simultaneously move
    everything from the default vhost to name-based&amp;nbsp;vhosts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ensure that old jantman.dyndns.org:10011 requests are being
    redirected properly, and requests for subdirectories under the web
    root are going to the right&amp;nbsp;subdomain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check that this all works acceptably with the existing
    blogger-to-wordpress rewrite&amp;nbsp;script.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finally&lt;/strong&gt; start rolling out some of the new services that I had
    waiting for the new&amp;nbsp;connection.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start the arduous process of reconfiguring my mail server, moving
    from Fetchmail from Verizon to an actual mail server, make
    everything work, and make sure my IPs aren&amp;#8217;t&amp;nbsp;blacklisted.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ugh.&lt;/strong&gt; Find anywhere in the entire &amp;#8216;net where my old @verizon.net
    address appeared (especially GoDaddy, DynDNS, other important stuff)
    and change it to the new jasonantman.com&amp;nbsp;address.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Since this is all in my mother&amp;#8217;s basement (there&amp;#8217;s nothing like a
    mother&amp;#8217;s love, especially when it comes to a constant hum emanating
    from the ground level of a house), figure out what to do for her
    when the verizon.net email goes&amp;nbsp;away.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I might have some downtime this weekend, but when things come back
up, I&amp;#8217;ll be done with this DynDNS and Port 10011&amp;nbsp;crap.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">admin</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 05 Mar 2009 10:22:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>tag:blog.jasonantman.com,2009-03-05:2009/03/big-changes-to-jasonantmancom/</guid><category>fios</category><category>optimum</category><category>vyatta</category></item></channel></rss>
