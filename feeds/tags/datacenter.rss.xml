    A bit of a rant, but makes some good points that are close to my

machines that need &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OS&lt;/span&gt; upgrades, my backup system is barely functional
(it needs both a new, large disk and a configuration overhaul), and I&amp;#8217;m
planning a switch to static &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IP&lt;/span&gt; service - which means not only a new
&lt;a href="http://www.vyatta.com/"&gt;router/firewall&lt;/a&gt; to design, configure and
monitor, as well as moving some services previously run by
&lt;a href="http://www.ipcop.org/"&gt;IPcop&lt;/a&gt; over to a dedicated box, but also finally
adding three IPsec VPNs, monitoring them and tunneling all sorts of
stuff over them, and reconfiguring all of my &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DNS&lt;/span&gt;, finding any hard-coded
URLs, and a slew of other&amp;nbsp;projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this got me thinking. While there are a number of reasons why I run
such a complex network at home (mainly including maintaining my presence
on the web and my email, providing temporary hosting for freelance work,
the convenience of file access from anywhere, the breadth of
administrative experience it gives me, and a way to test new
technologies) there are some parts of it that I just don&amp;#8217;t like dealing
with. I&amp;#8217;ve never been a really network-centric guy, and the idea of
having to setup a router/firewall (I&amp;#8217;m going with
&lt;a href="http://www.vyatta.com"&gt;Vyatta&lt;/a&gt; as it seems to be the &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; thing that
will deal with the complex configuration I want) for all this just to
get 5 static IPs seems a bit much. Not to mention there&amp;#8217;s just too much
running on all those boxen (8 at home, 2 at school, plus 3 others at 2
other locations) for me to keep a handle on all of it and still be a
full-time student, work 30 hours/week, and do freelance work.
Something&amp;#8217;s always bound to get ignored - sometimes backups stop for a
week, sometimes Nagios goes haywire, and sometimes Cacti stops graphing
for a month before I notice&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest thing I learned from running all of these systems for
personal use is to start everything consistently and with a plan. My
oldest box in semi-production is running SuSE 9.3, installed somewhere
between April and October of 2005. It was ignored for so long (a period
when it wasn&amp;#8217;t being used for much) that I now can&amp;#8217;t even perform
updates, as the update sequence is virtually impossible to accomplish.
Then again, re-purposed desktops shouldn&amp;#8217;t be in &amp;#8220;production&amp;#8221; for 4
years. Anyway, perhaps the biggest lesson in trying to deal with all of
this is the importance of consistency. Not just attempting to
standardize on one distribution, but also making a local image that
includes the standard packages, configurations, and other important
stuff - like the Nagios user account and local plugins and maybe even
the public &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SSH&lt;/span&gt; key of the Nagios box. Even better would be a
configuration management system like
&lt;a href="http://reductivelabs.com/trac/puppet"&gt;Puppet&lt;/a&gt; or
&lt;a href="http://www.cfengine.org/"&gt;CFengine&lt;/a&gt;, or even manually keeping all of
the distros updated to a common&amp;nbsp;version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, I digress. The real point of this post was supposed to be a simple
idea: I have all of this running at home, and I know quite a few &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IT&lt;/span&gt;
people who have a similar setup at home or at work, or have considerable
resources at a hosting/colo facility. So, why not start a &amp;#8220;community
datacenter&amp;#8221; project? At home I have to do everything from backups to
firewall and router administration to security. I&amp;#8217;d be much happier just
handling network/service monitoring, log analysis, and some tool and web
scripting. I know a few Cisco-heads who run their &amp;#8220;home&amp;#8221; LANs on chassis
switches, but find it such a pain to reconfigure Apache or run a
monitoring app. I&amp;#8217;m sure someone&amp;#8217;s thought of this in the past, and
probably tried it, but why don&amp;#8217;t some guys (who can be trusted) get
together, find some colo space (or anywhere with power and connectivity)
and start, essentially, a co-op data center? Assuming you could find a
large enough circle of trusted friends, I&amp;#8217;m sure you could find someone
willing to volunteer every service needed - from network engineering to
backups, monitoring, and security - in exchange for some rack space and
connectivity, or even a virtual host. I know I&amp;#8217;d opt in any second - or
even let someone throw a box in my basement in exchange for someone to
help read through logs or setup a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTTPS&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VPN&lt;/span&gt;, if it weren&amp;#8217;t for the
archaic equipment I&amp;#8217;m&amp;nbsp;running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just a&amp;nbsp;thought&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">admin</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 07 Feb 2009 00:50:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>tag:newblog.jasonantman.com,2009-02-07:2009/02/community-datacenter/</guid><category>community</category><category>datacenter</category></item></channel></rss>
