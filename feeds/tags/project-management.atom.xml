and to

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking for some advice here, as my search has turned up to be pretty&amp;nbsp;fruitless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My group (9 people - SAs, programmers, and two network guys) is
looking for some sort of web tool to&amp;#8230; ahem&amp;#8230; &amp;#8220;facilitate increased
collaboration&amp;#8221; (we didn&amp;#8217;t use a buzzword generator, I swear). At the
moment, we have an unified ticketing system that&amp;#8217;s braindead, but is
here to stay for political/logistical reasons. We&amp;#8217;ve got 2 wikis
(&amp;#8220;old&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;new&amp;#8221;), neither of which fulfill our needs, and are
therefore not used very often. We&amp;#8217;re looking for a free (as in both
cost and open source) web-based&amp;nbsp;tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Management side:&lt;br /&gt;
 Wants to be able to track project status, who&amp;#8217;s doing what, whether
deadlines are being met, etc. Doesn&amp;#8217;t want full-fledged &amp;#8220;project
management&amp;#8221; app, just something where we can update &amp;#8220;yeah this was
done&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;waiting for Bob to configure the widgets&amp;#8221;.
&lt;a href="http://www.teambox.com"&gt;TeamBox&lt;/a&gt; was suggested, but it seems almost
too gimmicky (Twitter/Facebook ripoff?), and doesn&amp;#8217;t seem to meet any
of the other requirements that I see coming&amp;nbsp;up:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Non-management side:&lt;br /&gt;
 - flexible, powerful wiki for all documentation (i.e. includes good
tables, easy markup, syntax highlighting, etc.)&lt;br /&gt;
 - good full text search of everything (i.e. type in a hostname and
get every instance anyone ever uttered that name)&lt;br /&gt;
 - task lists or ToDo lists, hopefully about to be grouped into a
number of &amp;#8220;projects&amp;#8221;&lt;br /&gt;
 - file uploads&lt;br /&gt;
 - &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RSS&lt;/span&gt; or Atom feeds, email alerts of&amp;nbsp;updates&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;re open to doing some customizations (adding some features,
notification/feeds, searching, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SVN&lt;/span&gt; integration, etc.) but need
something F/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;OSS&lt;/span&gt; that will run under&amp;nbsp;Apache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My conundrum is that most of the choices I&amp;#8217;ve found so far fall into
one of these categories:&lt;br /&gt;
 - project management/task tracking with poor
wiki/documentation/knowledge base support&lt;br /&gt;
 - wiki with no task tracking support&lt;br /&gt;
 - ticketing system with everything else bolted on (we already have
one that we&amp;#8217;re stuck with)&lt;br /&gt;
 - code-centric application (we do little &amp;#8220;development&amp;#8221;, mostly &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SA&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;work)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any&amp;nbsp;suggestions?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or, lacking that, any comments on which software would be easiest to
add the lacking features to (hopefully ending up with something that
actually looks good and works&amp;nbsp;well)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m still awaiting responses from both &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SAGE&lt;/span&gt; and ServerFault, but I have
a strong feeling that most of the suggestions will fall into one of the
major categories I already identified,&amp;nbsp;mainly:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Project management/task tracking with poor wiki/documentation
    support (a la&amp;nbsp;TeamBox)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wiki with no task tracking&amp;nbsp;support&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ticketing system with everything else added in (useless since we
    already have to use a different ticketing&amp;nbsp;system).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Something code-centric, i.e. built around a software development
    workflow, which isn&amp;#8217;t&amp;nbsp;us.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I have a very strong feeling that whatever solution we end up going
with, we&amp;#8217;ll need to spend quite a bit of time bolting on whatever else
we need. Adding a full-featured wiki to another package isn&amp;#8217;t going to
be very easy&amp;#8230; especially since TeamBox is written in RoR, and we&amp;#8217;re
mostly &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;guys.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="collaboration"></category><category term="documentation"></category><category term="project management"></category><category term="Projects"></category><category term="wiki"></category></entry></feed>
