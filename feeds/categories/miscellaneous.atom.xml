&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, Friday October 21st, 2016, Internet users in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; (initially the East Coast) experienced issues accessing many popular websites, including Twitter, Etsy, Spotify, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CNN&lt;/span&gt;, Amazon and others. This also affected numerous companies and services used heavily in the technology industry for everything from storing and sharing source code to monitoring the health of services and alerting on-call technical&amp;nbsp;staff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cause of the problems was an outage of Dyn, one of the leading providers of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DNS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; services, the system which translates human-readable domain names (like &amp;#8220;blog.jasonantman.com&amp;#8221;) to the numeric &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IP&lt;/span&gt; addresses actually used by computers to communicate. Aside from the immediate take-away - that so many high-traffic websites are relying on a single &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DNS&lt;/span&gt; provider, and therefore a single point of failure - there are a number of important points about what&amp;nbsp;happened:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) This was not an accidental outage, it was an intentional attack by a malicious party; specifically a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack"&gt;distributed denial of service (DDoS)&lt;/a&gt; attack, where an attacker takes control of tens or hundreds of thousands, or millions, of computers, and uses them to bombard the target with data. Assuming enough data is generated, as was the case yesterday, this will overwhelm the target, preventing it from fulfilling the requests of legitimate users. This was a very visible, intentional attack on critical Internet&amp;nbsp;infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2) Some of the leading experts on computer security, people who consult for Fortune-500 companies and have substantial access to non-public information, &lt;a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2016/09/someone_is_lear.html"&gt;believe&lt;/a&gt; that this attack was one of a series carried out by an advanced, well-funded nation state attacker (likely either China or Russia, with evidence pointing to the former). Furthermore, evidence points to this attack not being the end-goal, but rather part of an escalating test to determine the point of failure of critical Internet infrastructure. The cyber equivalent of test-firing missiles and flying over enemy territory to map defenses, in preparation for an attack. Homeland Security and the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FBI&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-cyber-idUSKCN12L1ME"&gt;are investigating&lt;/a&gt;, but have not speculated publicly on the source of the&amp;nbsp;attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3) The &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/10/hacked-cameras-dvrs-powered-todays-massive-internet-outage/"&gt;source&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://thehackernews.com/2016/10/iot-dyn-ddos-attack.html"&gt;of&lt;/a&gt; the flood of traffic that caused the outage was a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botnet"&gt;botnet&lt;/a&gt;, a large network of tens of millions of computers that were hijacked by the attacker and used to send massive amounts of data to Dyn&amp;#8217;s systems. More specifically, the computers in this instance were &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things"&gt;&amp;#8220;Internet of Things&amp;#8221; (IoT)&lt;/a&gt; Internet-connected devices, mainly &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IP&lt;/span&gt;-based video/surveillance cameras and video recorders; everything from warehouse and corporate surveillance cameras to &amp;#8220;nanny cams&amp;#8221; and video baby monitors. These devices pose a significant risk to the Internet, and therefore to our economic and physical infrastructure; they&amp;#8217;re often manufactured by companies that provide little to no support (the most common manufacturer provides none, selling their goods &amp;#8220;white box&amp;#8221; to be relabeled by distributors) and sold to users with little to no technical expertise. Unfortunately, there&amp;#8217;s also no legal requirement in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; for them to be secure, generally no procedure for software updates, and usually no way for users to enhance the security of the&amp;nbsp;devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first two pieces of information should be deeply disturbing to all of us; in an age when &amp;#8220;cyber warfare&amp;#8221; is constantly in the media, yesterday&amp;#8217;s even is the modern equivalent of a foreign power sending fighter planes over Washington, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DC&lt;/span&gt;, to see how we react. There&amp;#8217;s no plausible explanation for this, short of testing our defenses for an imminent or possible attack. It&amp;#8217;s also important to note the implications of this beyond Twitter and Etsy; an attack of this magnitude launched against more than one - or all - of the leading &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DNS&lt;/span&gt; providers at once would cripple everything from banking, payments and credit card processing to healthcare and travel, and possibly large portions of our transportation, power and utility infrastructure. All areas of modern American life have become inextricably linked to the health of the Internet, whether we realize it or not (ever tried to eat at a restaurant when their &amp;#8220;computers were down,&amp;#8221; or fill your car with gas when there was a local Internet outage?) And while the original core of the network that became the Internet was designed to withstand a cold-war nuclear attack, the modern infrastructure relies increasingly on a small number of private companies. An attack of the scale possible from a nation-state has never happened before, and it&amp;#8217;s not likely that it would be handled&amp;nbsp;well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a separate note, the use of IoT &amp;#8220;smart&amp;#8221; devices in this attack is particularly unsettling. While most people expect that their desktop and laptop computers and smartphones will receive regular software updates from a company that cares about their continued functionality, and expect that their devices won&amp;#8217;t be hijacked to attack critical infrastructure, the same is not true of the exploding field of &amp;#8220;smart&amp;#8221; devices. Robotic vacuum cleaners, Internet-based baby monitors, light bulbs that can be dimmed from your phone and networked thermostats are often sold as appliances at face-value, with very little ongoing support. Most people who buy these devices expect them to just work as advertised, and to be secure - they expect their baby monitor to &lt;a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/baby-monitors-connect-internet-vulnerable-hackers-cybersecurity/"&gt;not let hackers watch inside their homes&lt;/a&gt; and they expect their light bulbs to not attack critical Internet infrastructure on behalf of a third party. Perhaps the worst part is that, as many manufacturers of such devices are neither &amp;#8220;computer companies&amp;#8221; nor terribly interested in long-term customer relationships, every insecure device that&amp;#8217;s sold will likely be in operation for the next five to ten years, or more. We need both a legislative solution to this, as well as a consumer-focused solution; perhaps the modern equivalent of Underwriter&amp;#8217;s Laboratory for computerized devices. Without a solution, we may well end up in the world where, as &lt;a href="http://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/45098.html"&gt;suggested by some experts&lt;/a&gt;, it will be up to the Internet Service Provider of befuddled users to disconnect their service when a foreign power turns their toaster into a&amp;nbsp;weapon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update Sunday October 23rd, 2016:&lt;/strong&gt; I didn&amp;#8217;t find it until now, but yesterday Dyn published an initial &lt;a href="http://hub.dyn.com/static/hub.dyn.com/dyn-blog/dyn-statement-on-10-21-2016-ddos-attack.html"&gt;statement on the attack&lt;/a&gt; on their Blog. The details confirm what I read earlier and said above, but only add one new bit of information beyond what I&amp;#8217;d read earlier: the botnet(s) acting as the source of the attack were vastly larger than originally stated; &amp;#8220;tens of millions of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IP&lt;/span&gt; addresses&amp;#8221; rather than the approximately 500,000 originally suspected. I&amp;#8217;ll be keeping an eye out for a more detailed follow-up from&amp;nbsp;Dyn.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Dyn"></category><category term="DNS"></category><category term="botnet"></category><category term="security"></category><category term="DDoS"></category></entry><entry><title>The Psychological Side of Remote Work</title><link href="https://blog.jasonantman.com/2016/08/the-psychological-side-of-remote-work/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-08-26T15:10:00-04:00</published><updated>2016-08-26T15:10:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Jason Antman</name></author><id>tag:blog.jasonantman.com,2016-08-26:/2016/08/the-psychological-side-of-remote-work/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Some thoughts on the psychological aspects of remote&amp;nbsp;work&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;For most of my professional career, I&amp;#8217;ve worked from home a few days a week - and a few times, for
stretches of a few weeks - and that&amp;#8217;s been the norm on most of my teams, not counting full-time
remote workers. But for all the talk about remote work, much of it seems to focus on tools,
collaboration and productivity - and relatively little on the human side, and tips to help
balance work and life when the work happens in your home (or wherever else you&amp;nbsp;are).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These certainly aren&amp;#8217;t for everyone, but here are some of the tricks I&amp;#8217;ve accumulated so
far that help me be happier, more productive and more sane when working from home, whether
it&amp;#8217;s a day or few a week or a few weeks straight. I know these aren&amp;#8217;t applicable to everyone,
and they also assume a culture that already values work-life balance, but might not spend
a lot of time talking about the little hacks to make remote work better. Not all of these
will work for every person, and there are plenty I&amp;#8217;m surely forgetting or not aware&amp;nbsp;of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="1-dress-for-the-job"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#1-dress-for-the-job"&gt;1. Dress for the&amp;nbsp;Job&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve made the &amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;m working from home so I&amp;#8217;m not wearing pants&amp;#8221; joke plenty of times
myself. But it&amp;#8217;s never true. When I&amp;#8217;m working from home, the first thing I do is
go through the same morning routine I do when going in to the office - most importantly,
making coffee and getting dressed. Lately I&amp;#8217;ve taken to wearing &amp;#8220;nicer&amp;#8221; (read: having
buttons somewhere on them) shirts to the office, and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt;, I&amp;#8217;ll wear a t-shirt when I&amp;#8217;m
home. But I still put on long pants and&amp;nbsp;shoes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, this is a big part of the psychological side of work/life separation. I have
&amp;#8220;work clothes&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;hanging around the house&amp;#8221; clothes. When I&amp;#8217;m going to be working,
I wear work clothes. When I&amp;#8217;m done for the day, a (psychologically) big part of my
end-of-the-work-day routine is changing from work clothes to &amp;#8220;hanging around&amp;#8221;&amp;nbsp;clothes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whoever I heard this from - and I&amp;#8217;m sad to say I don&amp;#8217;t even remember who it was - probably
sounded crazy to me. But it really goes a long way to psychologically separate work time
from personal time - especially on the days when I finish up work and get right back to
the keyboard working on personal projects or&amp;nbsp;gaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="2-separate-profiles"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#2-separate-profiles"&gt;2. Separate&amp;nbsp;Profiles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep separate profiles in your browser, one for work and one for personal.
&lt;a href="https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/2364824?hl=en"&gt;Chrome&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href="https://www.chromium.org/user-experience/multi-profiles"&gt;Chromium&lt;/a&gt; have support
for separate users; Firefox recently added built-in
&lt;a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/profile-manager-create-and-remove-firefox-profiles"&gt;support for switching profiles&lt;/a&gt;,
which is quite nice for those of us who had been using &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Profile_Manager"&gt;Profile Manager&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I&amp;#8217;m sure there are some people who do this simply to keep history/bookmarks/etc. separate,
I do it as an incentive to focus on work when I&amp;#8217;m at work and focus on not work when I&amp;#8217;m not.
At the end of my work day I close my &amp;#8220;work&amp;#8221; browser session and open my &amp;#8220;personal&amp;#8221; one back
up. Thanks to session restore, all of my tabs are right where I left them&amp;#8230; and I don&amp;#8217;t have
a reason to leave distracting personal tabs open during the work day, or work tabs open
when I&amp;#8217;m on my own&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(I know this doesn&amp;#8217;t work for everyone, especially if you&amp;#8217;re on-call and it&amp;#8217;s busy. In those
cases, I usually keep tabs in separate windows, one for work and one for personal; it&amp;#8217;s all
there when I need it, but out of the way when I&amp;nbsp;don&amp;#8217;t).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="3-take-breaks"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#3-take-breaks"&gt;3. Take&amp;nbsp;Breaks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I&amp;#8217;m physically in the office, my day is usually broken up by moments away from my computer
work with colleagues - whether it&amp;#8217;s walking to a meeting or lunch, whatever conversations pop up
in the room, or even just whiteboarding a problem. Sure, there&amp;#8217;s plenty of conversation on HipChat
when we&amp;#8217;re remote, but I&amp;#8217;m not &lt;em&gt;getting away from the keyboard&lt;/em&gt; like I do in the&amp;nbsp;office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take breaks. Take the dogs out, take five minutes to play with your kids or pets, go make coffee
or lunch, whatever. Just be sure to break up your day and not fall into the trap of sitting in
the same spot for however many hours staring at a monitor. Our bodies need &amp;#8220;get up and walk around&amp;#8221;
time, but our minds need a change of scenery too. Five minutes away from the same monitor is helpful.
Sure, if I&amp;#8217;m deep in the middle of something, I&amp;#8217;ll keep at it. But I usually find that stepping
away for a few minutes now and then at logical context switch points helps a lot. And if it&amp;#8217;s
a day of mostly writing code, it also provides a good time to think about what I&amp;#8217;m working on
without the burning urge to immediately start&amp;nbsp;implementing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#8217;t fall into the trap of feeling that work from home time demands that
you&amp;#8217;re glued to the keyboard every second without pause - nobody in the office is doing that.
And don&amp;#8217;t fall into the trap of feeling like you have to prove you&amp;#8217;re being productive while
remote by never taking a break - if you&amp;#8217;re like many people I know, you&amp;#8217;re probably already
more productive when you&amp;#8217;re in an environment that feels more comfortable (you can always
point people to Psychology Today&amp;#8217;s
&lt;a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/mind-the-manager/201605/remote-workers-are-happier-and-more-productive"&gt;Remote Workers Are Happier and More Productive&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, don&amp;#8217;t give up opportunities to change your surroundings. If you have a webinar or
online meeting, grab the laptop and take it from the couch (assuming the setting is acceptable
for the attendees). Need to read a lengthy article or documentation? Bring the laptop
outside. Anything to get a mental and visual change of&amp;nbsp;pace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="4-lunch-is-holy"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#4-lunch-is-holy"&gt;4. Lunch is&amp;nbsp;Holy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I&amp;#8217;m in the office, if my team doesn&amp;#8217;t have lunch plans (which is the rule rather
than the exception), I tend to eat at my desk, and only take as much time as I need
to eat. Sometimes I&amp;#8217;m good to myself and read something, other times I just work while
I&amp;nbsp;eat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I&amp;#8217;m at home, I take the 45 minutes we&amp;#8217;re given for lunch, every day. If my wife is
home, we watch something on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TV&lt;/span&gt; and eat together. If she isn&amp;#8217;t, I catch up on an episode
of something on Netflix. But no matter what I do, I set aside the full &amp;#8220;official&amp;#8221;
45 minutes to decompress, step away from the keyboard, and breathe a bit. Sure, sometimes
my mind is still churning away on whatever I&amp;#8217;m working on, and I usually only break
for food at a logical stopping point. But it&amp;#8217;s still an important part of staying
focused through the day, and not hitting the end of the day feeling exhausted and&amp;nbsp;glassy-eyed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="5-disconnect"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#5-disconnect"&gt;5.&amp;nbsp;Disconnect&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On-call or similar exceptions aside, when they day&amp;#8217;s over, the day&amp;#8217;s over. Disconnect.
I have HipChat and various other communication tools on my phone if I absolutely have
to be reached after hours. But aside from that, when my work day is over, I close my
work browser session and switch to personal, close any editors/windows/etc. I have open,
and ensure all of my changes are committed and pushed. As much as I occasionally rue
the fact that my current job has almost everything on our private network, it means
I can disconnect my &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VPN&lt;/span&gt; client and be unable to access anything work-related. I&amp;#8217;ll
admit that I usually leave my work-related &lt;code&gt;screen&lt;/code&gt; windows open overnight, just
for ease of picking back up, but I always close them over a weekend or&amp;nbsp;vacation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unless you&amp;#8217;re being paid for a 168-hour work week, you deserve to have some time
away from work. I&amp;#8217;ll admit I&amp;#8217;ve had some jobs where on-call was&amp;#8230; quite busy&amp;#8230;
but it doesn&amp;#8217;t take that long to connect and start up what you need, when needed.
You owe it to yourself: when you&amp;#8217;re done, make the work stuff disappear from your
field of view. If you spend much time at your computer outside of work, you need
to keep the two separate&amp;#8230; or else &amp;#8220;work time&amp;#8221; becomes &amp;#8220;awake&amp;nbsp;time.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="6-end-of-day-routine"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#6-end-of-day-routine"&gt;6. End-of-day&amp;nbsp;Routine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Develop a daily end-of-work routine or ritual. Do something to psychologically say
to yourself &amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;m done with work for today, I&amp;#8217;m switching gears to my personal life.&amp;#8221;
If your office is also your home, you miss out on the decompression and context switch
provided by a commute (even a short one). Put something in its place. This is
especially important if your after-work time, even occasionally, involves going back
to the same chair, keyboard and monitor(s) - whatever the&amp;nbsp;reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Change your clothes, catch up with family, spend some time with your pets, watch a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TV&lt;/span&gt;
show or read a book, cook dinner, go for a walk - whatever. Just do something to signal
to yourself that the work day is over, and you can leave all of those thoughts, anxieties,
problems, ideas and tasks until tomorrow. As much as you may intellectually know that
you&amp;#8217;re &amp;#8220;done&amp;#8221; for the day (even if your pager might go off), do something to &lt;em&gt;show&lt;/em&gt;
yourself, and tell your subconscious, that you&amp;#8217;re &amp;#8220;going&amp;nbsp;home.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="7-get-outside"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#7-get-outside"&gt;7. Get&amp;nbsp;Outside&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m an introvert, and have occasionally suffered from mild depression. Neither of those
is unusual in our industry; the former is just much more accepted and discussed
than the latter&amp;nbsp;(unfortunately).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you can, &lt;strong&gt;get outside&lt;/strong&gt;. Even if it&amp;#8217;s just to run an errand, take a short walk,
or drive around the block, get out of the house. This is especially important if
you usually don&amp;#8217;t (but can), or if you&amp;#8217;re working long hours. At a previous job
we had an &amp;#8220;incident&amp;#8221; that resulted in the engineering team working round-the-clock
for the better part of two weeks; we ended up scheduling a 24x7 rotation, but until
that two-week-ish mark, we were all more-or-less working whenever we were awake.
It was awful for all of us - both our personal well-being and our productivity
and focus. Even just running to the store or to pick up dinner was an immense
relief from the wake-work-sleep-repeat&amp;nbsp;cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if you&amp;#8217;re not working insane hours (and I certainly hope you&amp;#8217;re not), be aware
of how much time you&amp;#8217;re spending at home indoors. If you&amp;#8217;re not terribly social by
nature, make sure you get outside, and do it on a regular basis. Even if you don&amp;#8217;t
&lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to go somewhere, do it anyway for a change of scenery and a chance to clear
your&amp;nbsp;mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="8-talk-about-burnout-and-frustrations"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#8-talk-about-burnout-and-frustrations"&gt;8. Talk About Burnout and&amp;nbsp;Frustrations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This goes for everyone, but more so for people who are remote full-time or for
long stretches, on a team that&amp;#8217;s at least partially in-office. It&amp;#8217;s really easy
to feel disconnected from what&amp;#8217;s happening, and it&amp;#8217;s also really difficult -
especially if you do most of your communication via text - for your manager and
co-workers to know when you&amp;#8217;re feeling stressed or overworked. Talk about&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Burnout - even to the point of suicide - in technology has been talked about
more recently, including John Willis&amp;#8217;
&lt;a href="http://itrevolution.com/karojisatsu/"&gt;Karōjisatsu&lt;/a&gt;, Gene Kim&amp;#8217;s recent work,
and &lt;a href="https://victorops.com/blog/burnout-in-tech/"&gt;Jason Hand&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;#8217;s certainly
something that our industry needs to be &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; more aware of, and something we
all need to work to fix, both personally and with our colleagues. If you&amp;#8217;re a
manager of remotes, make sure you check in with them often - not just on how
their work is going, but on how they&amp;#8217;re doing emotionally, especially related
to work. Find out what&amp;#8217;s frustrating them, what&amp;#8217;s draining their energy and
how their work-life balance is. If you&amp;#8217;re not a manager, check in with your
coworkers about the same things, and make sure someone knows how you&amp;#8217;re doing.

But I&amp;#8217;ve always put that aside - partially because this &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; comes up when I&amp;#8217;m looking for a new job and I don&amp;#8217;t really want to be remembered as that guy with the strongly disagreeing views, partially because I don&amp;#8217;t want people looking for technical content to be frustrated by my rants. And partially because it&amp;#8217;s just harder for me to convey political or social concepts in the way I intend than it is to convey technical ones. But after the events of the past 36 hours - and moreover, of the past decade-plus - I&amp;#8217;m going to deviate from that. &lt;strong&gt;Be advised&lt;/strong&gt; that if you have strong feelings on either side of the gun control debate, this probably isn&amp;#8217;t going to make you&amp;nbsp;happy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m a gun owner. I have been since my eighteenth birthday, the day when I became legally able to exercise my second amendment rights in my then-home state of New Jersey. That was only a decade ago, but the impact of guns on America seems so shockingly different. I own a single .22-caliber target pistol; certainly dangerous as any firearm is, but essentially the bottom of the scale when it comes to lethality. It&amp;#8217;s designed to shoot paper, not much else. I&amp;#8217;ve been shooting off and on since I was in my early teens, mostly handguns and shotguns. Apparently unlike most people who are vocal gun owners, I&amp;#8217;ve never fired a shot at anything that is or was ever alive, unless you count paper. I&amp;#8217;ve never fired a shot outside of a shooting&amp;nbsp;range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve also never carried a gun in public, nor have I ever had a serious desire to. Despite what gun-rights activists claim about self-defense and defense of others, I think that the way police in this country are both trained and act in the field is a wonderful example of why firearm carry in public often doesn&amp;#8217;t work: we&amp;#8217;re talking about people whose &lt;em&gt;profession&lt;/em&gt; involves firearms, who must train and qualify with their guns annually (or more often), and still often can&amp;#8217;t hit a target in a real-life situation. As far as I&amp;#8217;m concerned, if someone wants to carry a firearm to defend themselves or others, they damn well better be shooting &lt;em&gt;every day&lt;/em&gt;, doing live-fire training, and completely confident that they could identify and hit a target in real life. To my knowledge, only the most elite units of the military do this. I grew up in New Jersey, where the only people who carry guns are law enforcement and criminals, period (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt;, there are some &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; rare exceptions). I now live in Georgia, where anyone can walk into WalMart and walk out with a gun - and many people walk around the store with handguns on their belts, something that&amp;#8217;s still foreign to&amp;nbsp;me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On my eighteenth birthday, I went to the police department in my home town to begin the process of purchasing the target pistol that my father had offered as a gift. For those of you who aren&amp;#8217;t familiar with how gun (specifically handgun - it&amp;#8217;s significantly easier for shotguns and rifles) ownership works in the northeast, here&amp;#8217;s the gist of it (my memory may be a bit hazy, and some of it may have been explained&amp;nbsp;poorly):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I went to the police department and met with the chief, whom I already knew personally through&amp;nbsp;family.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I paid a fee of approximately $100 and filled out about six pages of paperwork, including a full history of my addresses and a lengthy&amp;nbsp;questionnaire.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I was fingerprinted - all ten fingers, three sets of&amp;nbsp;prints.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I filled out consent forms for federal and state background checks and consents for mental health records&amp;nbsp;searches.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These were all sent out to the respective&amp;nbsp;agencies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;About a month later, the chief called to tell me that he&amp;#8217;d received the replies from the federal and state governments, and they came back &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt; (which is to be expected, as I had no mental health history and no criminal&amp;nbsp;record).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He then sent out form letters to the three non-related character references I had specified on my application, requesting them to assert under penalty of perjury whether they believed that I posed any danger to myself or others, if I were allowed to purchase a&amp;nbsp;firearm.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The letters were all returned by my references. The chief then sent the completed paperwork back to the state government, which issued me a state firearms purchaser identification card, entitling me to purchase firearms and ammunition. I was also issued - as requested - a Permit to Purchase a Handgun, which entitled me to purchase one (1) handgun within 90 days of the date of&amp;nbsp;issue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt;, so that&amp;#8217;s quite a process. All in all, it took two or three months to&amp;nbsp;complete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I finally received my &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ID&lt;/span&gt; card and permit - which had to be picked up in person - I headed out to a local gun store to find the model I wanted. And I did. I turned the purchase permit over to the salesperson, who called the state government to verify its validity. We finalized the details of the transaction and I inspected the merchandise and filled out some last paperwork. The gun I&amp;#8217;d purchased was then marked with a &amp;#8220;sold&amp;#8221; sticker and had a copy of the invoice attached, and was locked in a safe for me to pick up in seven days, when the mandatory waiting period was over. When I returned a week later, one of the two spent cartridges from the gun (shipped with it by the manufacturer) was sent to the state police for future forensic&amp;nbsp;use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Jersey is widely regarded as having some of the strictest gun control laws in the country. And none of that is enough. There was never a follow-up. There was no ongoing monitoring that I&amp;#8217;m aware of. I&amp;#8217;ve heard more stories than I can remember of people being convicted of crimes or involved in domestic violence situations, and then using their legally-purchased and registered firearms in future crimes. It makes no sense to me that we live in a world where Amazon knows what items I&amp;#8217;m interested in today, but the authorities can&amp;#8217;t figure out to take my gun away if I assault someone. There was also never a mandatory proficiency or safety test, either written or at a real firing&amp;nbsp;range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How is it that we live in a country where operation of a motor vehicle - a device which &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; be fatal when operated improperly - requires a written examination, a practical demonstration of skill, and an ongoing demonstration of responsibility (traffic police), but the possession and operation of a firearm does not? It makes no sense. I don&amp;#8217;t want to minimize the effects of poor driving decisions, they certainly claim many lives, but there&amp;#8217;s no avoiding the fact that firearms were - and in many cases, are - &lt;em&gt;designed&lt;/em&gt; to&amp;nbsp;kill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suppose that most of my feelings on this are based on two of my core beliefs, which run contrary to many gun-rights activists: (1) that my only use for a firearm is target shooting, and it doesn&amp;#8217;t really matter to me how quickly I can buy one, and (2) that our military has tanks and nukes, and the idea of &amp;#8220;defending my Freedom [against a government takeover]&amp;#8221; with any legally-purchased weapon is impossible, regardless of whether or not it&amp;#8217;s simply&amp;nbsp;paranoid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether openly or not, many gun rights activists base their positions on a romanticized fictional &amp;#8220;past America&amp;#8221;, where everyone was good, owned guns, defended themselves, and was self-sufficient. Even if that past world existed (in reality it was quite violent; the violence just isn&amp;#8217;t remembered in the Utopian narrative), it&amp;#8217;s certainly not today. The past America they speak of was a time when most gun owners had been so since childhood (it was merely a part of living), likely had many fewer violent influences, and could count on swift justice. Let&amp;#8217;s also remember the technology of this past age: I might be &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt; with gun rights activists going back to this mythical past, if they also could only have a six-shot revolver that takes a few minutes to&amp;nbsp;reload.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But despite what gun rights activists try to tell us, the problem here is not hardcore criminals. It&amp;#8217;s people who may or may not have criminal or suspicious pasts, who decide to act on their violent ideas. It&amp;#8217;s people who can walk into a store and buy a weapon or magazine that holds twenty or fifty rounds of ammunition - something which has no legitimate use other than mass killing. It&amp;#8217;s people who can borrow or steal guns from family or friends, because those firearms weren&amp;#8217;t treated with the proper respect and safety by their legal owners. It&amp;#8217;s the belief by some that there&amp;#8217;s a legitimate reason to obtain a gun in less than a week, or a month, or months. It&amp;#8217;s the ironic dichotomy of the people who believe that Snowden was a traitor and mass surveillance is fine, but registering guns is an unconstitutional invasion of privacy. And it has to stop. I dare say, if every mass shooting in the past decade or two was carried out by a Muslim or an immigrant or anyone other than a white Christian, half of the roadblocks to a safe America would&amp;#8217;ve&amp;nbsp;disappeared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To everyone who takes a literal reading of the Constitution and says that the second amendment grants every American the right to posses and carry as many and whatever kind of firearms they want, I make three&amp;nbsp;comments:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;falsely shouting &amp;#8216;fire&amp;#8217; in a crowded theater.&amp;#8221; We have a Supreme Court for a reason: that the framers knew the Constitution would have to be interpreted differently with&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you stand against gun registration or regulation, please keep in mind that your precious second amendment begins with the phrase, &amp;#8220;A well regulated Militia.&amp;#8221; Even if you don&amp;#8217;t believe that this is equivalent to a modern-day standing army, it clearly does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; say, &amp;#8220;Everybody gets all the firearms they want,&amp;nbsp;period.&amp;#8221;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.&amp;#8221; They weren&amp;#8217;t put in that order by&amp;nbsp;mistake.&lt;/li&gt;

and some schools are better than others; there are certainly programs that prepare students
much better than what I experienced. Second, these views are somewhat biased to my own
experience in the web, agile and DevOps worlds; for people who want to write Java for banks
their whole career, I&amp;#8217;m sure most schools prepare them&amp;nbsp;well.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s been a decade since I&amp;#8217;ve been in the University system, but I&amp;#8217;ve seen precious little to
indicate that much has changed since then. I graduated with a degree in &lt;a href="https://comminfo.rutgers.edu/component/cur,547/option,com_courses/sch,04/task,listing/"&gt;Information Technology
and Informatics (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ITI&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/a&gt;;
I switched majors partly because of my deep hatred for calculus, and partly
because I was already working for Rutgers University as a student systems programmer, and it
was painfully obvious how little the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CS&lt;/span&gt; program would do to prepare me for a career. My time
in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CS&lt;/span&gt; was spent writing pitifully small Java applications in teams as large as &lt;strong&gt;three&lt;/strong&gt; (any
team work was highly unusual) and playing with linked lists. I switched to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ITI&lt;/span&gt; so I could take
classes on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IT&lt;/span&gt; management and policy, information security and &amp;#8220;web application development&amp;#8221; (with
databases and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JSON&lt;/span&gt;!) Since then, I&amp;#8217;ve had two family members enter &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CS&lt;/span&gt; or &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ECE&lt;/span&gt; programs, and I
tried to give them the best advice I could. I happened to be thinking about it, and figured
I&amp;#8217;d write down some of my&amp;nbsp;thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First and foremost, I understand that technology changes very quickly - a lot quicker than
college syllabi. However, my alma mater&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href="https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/undergraduate/courses/"&gt;undergrad course list&lt;/a&gt;
does not appear to have changed &lt;em&gt;at all&lt;/em&gt; since I took some of those classes a decade ago.
Don&amp;#8217;t get me wrong, it&amp;#8217;s very good that we&amp;#8217;re teaching classes in Operating Systems Design
and Compilers. But current curricula seem to focus almost exclusively on fundamentals
and low-level details. When I was in college, almost all the classes were taught in Java,
and that already seemed dated and ignoring the &amp;#8220;Web 2.0&amp;#8221; world; these days, it relegates
most graduates to jobs that I&amp;#8217;d consider boring, in the Enterprise sector. Rutgers&amp;#8217; undergrad
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CS&lt;/span&gt; catalog doesn&amp;#8217;t list &amp;#8220;Internet Technology&amp;#8221; until &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CS&lt;/span&gt; 352, and I&amp;#8217;d be surprised if any
networking (aside from maybe &amp;#8220;use raw sockets to do something&amp;#8221;) is covered before that class,
which is tentatively designed for third-year students. Very few of the courses that I see
listed (and many that I looked at haven&amp;#8217;t changed their description, or even their instructor,
in ten years) do much to prepare students for the actual tech industry. Even worse, most
of them are the same classes that I found boring, and caused me to switch&amp;nbsp;majors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, I can understand the argument that tech moves too fast for class materials
to keep pace. But introducing the Internet as a third-year topic, and Distributed
Systems as a senior-level class? Writing &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; in Java? This seemed silly
to me a decade ago; now, it seems downright wrong for a department that claims to
prepare students for careers in technology. Once again, I agree that a strong grasp
of fundamentals is overwhelmingly important. However, a balance needs to be struck
between this and (1) providing students with useful, current skills, and (2) keeping
students interested. In a world where more and more (and in many areas, such as my own
subculture, almost all) software runs in the browser, how can education ignore&amp;nbsp;this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ll take a small moment to dovetail this to a heated topic in tech at the moment:
hiring practices and diversity. The tech education at most universities does little
to prepare students for actual jobs outside of, quite literally, &amp;#8220;entry-level Java
programmer&amp;#8221;. The people who will get good, interesting jobs in tech (yes, that&amp;#8217;s quite
opinionated; I&amp;#8217;m defining that as jobs with web or DevOps shops) are the ones who
either have ample free time and pre-existing interest to hack on their own projects,
and/or are insomniacs and can handle going to class, working, and still writing
a lot of code and experimenting on their own. I suppose this ends up being biased
towards stereotypical white males, even if only because it seems socially acceptable
for us to ignore having a social life in favor of finishing those last lines of&amp;nbsp;code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I digress. There are few other industries that I can think of - and certainly
no professions - where someone leaves the University system with the highest
degree commonly attained in their field, yet has virtually zero real world
hands-on experience. I&amp;#8217;ll leave out the doctor or lawyer analogies, but some
of our closest parallels - engineers, architects, etc. - graduate and are able
to start practicing their profession. Sure, there&amp;#8217;s organization- or domain-specific
on the job training, but for the most part, they can do what they were hired to do.
On the other hand, tech-focused programs are turning out graduates many of whom
have never seen the tools (or even languages) that we use. They don&amp;#8217;t have
any real experience working in teams larger than three or four (at the best),
and have no concept of what goes into developing real software, working in
a large (or distributed) team, or what happens to software after someone
grades it (which in my experience, was usually as simple as &amp;#8220;does this program
produce the right output when it&amp;#8217;s run at the command&amp;nbsp;line).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, that&amp;#8217;s my rant. What do I think should be covered in tech/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CS&lt;/span&gt; curricula that isn&amp;#8217;t?
Here are a&amp;nbsp;few:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Testing&lt;/strong&gt; - I have painful memories of being marked as failing assignments because
I used a tab when the instructors expected some number of spaces in the output of my
program. In most cases, my instructors used a test harness that exec&amp;#8217;ed our Java applications
and inspected the string output. I still have no idea why they didn&amp;#8217;t use JUnit. But that&amp;#8217;s
beyond the point; we&amp;#8217;re turning out programmers who don&amp;#8217;t know what unit or integration tests
are. I still don&amp;#8217;t understand how I got through a four-year degree, partially in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CS&lt;/span&gt; and
partially in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IT&lt;/span&gt;, without writing a single test for any program I wrote (aside from a few
courses where we wrote &amp;#8220;test harnesses&amp;#8221;, but never used a proper testing&amp;nbsp;framework).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Software Distribution&lt;/strong&gt; - Here&amp;#8217;s another no-brainer. Why - especially when working in
Java - would students email completed assignments to professors, or upload them to online
courseware, when so many artifact repositories exist? If people can&amp;#8217;t use your software it&amp;#8217;s
pretty pointless. Distribution should be a part of at least some assignments, whether it&amp;#8217;s
an open source model or just uploading an artifact to an internal maven&amp;nbsp;repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maintenance&lt;/strong&gt; - Ok, sure, this is the part that none of us really like. But it&amp;#8217;s also
an inherent part of what we do, and the odds are most entry-level programmers will first
find themselves fixing bugs or adding features to someone else&amp;#8217;s application. Being able
to read and understand existing code is perhaps the most important thing we do, whether it&amp;#8217;s
to fix it or just to learn from it. Nobody I&amp;#8217;ve talked to about education as a programmer
has ever encountered an assignment of &amp;#8220;here&amp;#8217;s an application, here&amp;#8217;s a bug report, find and
fix it&amp;#8221; beyond the most trivial contrived examples. The process of fixing a bug in or adding
a feature to an existing codebase is probably one of the most important lessons in learning
to write code - even if it&amp;#8217;s partially a lesson in what not to&amp;nbsp;do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Distributed Projects&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &amp;#8220;big&amp;#8221; project in my time as a student was pairing on a Java
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GUI&lt;/span&gt;/backend program. Perhaps I didn&amp;#8217;t have the best experience, as my partner neglected to write
any code. However, few people are going to enter the workforce and be the sole person touching
a given codebase. I think there should be much more emphasis on working as part of a realistically-sized
team. Sure, the tooling might not be the same, but at least graduates should have some experience
in collaborating with others, and more importantly, in working on code where they don&amp;#8217;t necessarily
understand all of it. If we&amp;#8217;re going to teach Java, we should at least be teaching it realistically
and throwing in some black-box classes or having students code to each others&amp;#8217; (not-yet-complete)&amp;nbsp;APIs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Web-First&lt;/strong&gt; - With the plummeting cost of cloud computing and containers, and the massive
compute farms available at most universities, there&amp;#8217;s really no excuse for completely ignoring
the Internet. Sure, it doesn&amp;#8217;t play much of a role in the low-level basics, but for the classic
&amp;#8220;hello world&amp;#8221;, calculator app, tic-tack-toe, etc. it&amp;#8217;s not really that much overhead to do
them in &lt;a href="http://spring.io/guides/gs/rest-service/"&gt;Spring&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/"&gt;Flask&lt;/a&gt;
or &lt;a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html"&gt;Rails&lt;/a&gt; and also give students exposure
to a modern, web-centric framework that someone might actually use to write a simple application.
Most programmers are probably going to touch the web at some point. I&amp;#8217;d argue that it&amp;#8217;s also a
lot more applicable for people who aren&amp;#8217;t going into a distinctly programming&amp;nbsp;role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Operable Software&lt;/strong&gt; - Going with the web-first paradigm, we have the virtualization or
container technology to give students a shell and a running web server. Why not show them
how to use it? I once failed a major assignment because the graders used a script that combined
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;STDOUT&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;STDERR&lt;/span&gt; and evaluated it. They asked me what all these weird lines in my output
were; I told them it was log4j. They asked what that was. Even the classes I took that
included working in teams or something else somewhat realistic, completely ignored the
operations side of software, as far as never discussing logging. If we want the quality
of software that we (as an industry) turn out to increase, one of the best things we can
do is introduce programmers to logging, testing, debugging and the operations side as early
as possible, even if in a quick, superficial way. If students had to actually &lt;em&gt;run&lt;/em&gt; their
app, and let it serve actual requests, they&amp;#8217;d have a lot clearer picture of what software
actually does after the build a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JAR&lt;/span&gt;. Related to this, an introduction to the concepts
of security and stability would be quite&amp;nbsp;useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;re currently going to school for something programming-related, here are a few
things that I&amp;#8217;d recommend doing to get ahead of the&amp;nbsp;pack:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn some languages. Look through job ads for the type of entry-level/graduate work you
hope to get when you graduate, and see what they&amp;#8217;re asking for. If your school is still the
way mine appears to be, in a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CS&lt;/span&gt; program you&amp;#8217;ll probably be exposed to Java and C. Learn some
Ruby or Python, or something else that&amp;#8217;s in use on the web. It certainly won&amp;#8217;t hurt you, and
it&amp;#8217;ll also be less intimidating to learn a new language once you already know a few, preferably
that are rather&amp;nbsp;different.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you want to work in the web world and are a Windows person, learn Linux. Despite what
some people tell you, it&amp;#8217;s the rule not the&amp;nbsp;exception.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read. I understand that not everyone has extensive time to experiment on their own, and I know
a lot of people who didn&amp;#8217;t, especially in college. Read. A lot. It seems that most tech programs
require a lot less work than other engineering disciplines; I remember how envious my &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ECE&lt;/span&gt; and Mech-E
friends were at the &amp;#8220;low&amp;#8221; amount of work we &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CS&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;IT&lt;/span&gt; majors had to do. Read everything you can, especially
about the industry you want to work in (if you have an idea of what it is). Find out what tools they&amp;#8217;re
using from job ads or company tech blogs, and find out about them. Even if you can&amp;#8217;t use them
yourself, at least knowing a bit about them will help a&amp;nbsp;lot.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you can, find an open source project or two to work on. This one comes with a bit of a warning;
the open source world can be quite abrasive, and sometimes downright hurtful. Unfortunately, technology
as a whole seems to attract a lot of very loud, angry, bad people. So do some research; try to find
a project that you&amp;#8217;re interested in and that you have some relevant experience for. But most importantly,
find a project that&amp;#8217;s clearly open to mentoring new contributors; they&amp;#8217;re unfortunately few and
far between, but it will really pay&amp;nbsp;off.&lt;/li&gt;

We used a web-based Kanban board (&lt;a href="https://github.com/cmheisel/kardboard"&gt;Kardboard&lt;/a&gt;, written by our director of development at the time), and each team had
their daily stand-up status meetings in the middle of the office in front of a projector screen, with their board filling the entire wall (and remotes on Skype). It took me a while
to get used to it, having always worked in very ticket-and-emergency-driven ops roles. But once it clicked, it was like an epiphany. Suddenly I could see all
of the (non-breakfix or unforeseen) work headed to our team, its priority and due dates, and what everyone (including myself) was working on at a given moment.
Even though work-in-progress (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;WIP&lt;/span&gt;) limits never made it to the ops team, it reduced my stress level amazingly. Instead of dealing with a massive queue of tickets
assigned to me - some of which were such low priority I&amp;#8217;d probably never get around to them - suddenly all I had to concern myself with was my &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WIP&lt;/span&gt; and what was
next up for&amp;nbsp;me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past year we&amp;#8217;ve had a major (almost complete) changeover of management, and many of the old ways have disappeared. Some might even say that, as a technical
company, we&amp;#8217;ve regressed quite a bit. Either way, we haven&amp;#8217;t been using Kanban for over six months. Our development teams are moving to &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_%28software_development%29"&gt;Scrum&lt;/a&gt;,
and our more ops-y teams (I&amp;#8217;m now on our Automation and Tooling team, straddling the awkward line between the two) are trying to figure out what&amp;#8217;s right for us.
And I haven&amp;#8217;t been this stressed since I started work here; my team is both busier than ever and understaffed by almost 50%. We stopped using the Kanban board in our
stand-ups, our new manager stopped referring to it, so (even with mostly-working synchronization with Jira) it stopped being useful, and I stopped using it. Without thinking,
I went back to my old &amp;#8220;page showing &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; assigned to me&amp;#8221; view in our ticketing system, and grew increasingly frustrated by managing my &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WIP&lt;/span&gt; and deciding what
needed to be worked&amp;nbsp;next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, after discussing this with the rest of my team, last week two of us came to the same conclusion, independently, on the same day: use &lt;a href="https://trello.com/"&gt;Trello&lt;/a&gt; to
run our own personal Kanban boards. I&amp;#8217;ve been doing so for about a week now, and all I&amp;#8217;m horribly embarrassed that I didn&amp;#8217;t think of this sooner. It&amp;#8217;s absolutely wonderful -
I can keep managing my own work in a Kanban-like form (albeit without formal &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WIP&lt;/span&gt; limits) without needing management endorsement. Sure, it only works for things that I know
are coming and takes some manual curation time, but so far, it&amp;#8217;s been amazingly refreshing and calming. The best part is being able to (once again) visually see
both my &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WIP&lt;/span&gt;, and my recently-complete&amp;nbsp;work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone else on my team mentioned that they use Trello for their personal tasks; I created two more boards, one for my personal development work, and another for my general
around-the-house tasks and to-do&amp;#8217;s (my wife connected with her inner manager once I shared my board with her and she figured out that she could re-order by backlog&amp;#8230;).
It&amp;#8217;s 8 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PM&lt;/span&gt; on Sunday night, and I can confidently say that I&amp;#8217;ve had one of the most productive weekends in ages. And one of the most relaxing. Instead of spending
lots of time trying to figure out what I have to do this weekend and what the priorities are, I just used the same Kanban method that I loved from work. And it
paid&amp;nbsp;off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-greasemonkey-script"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#the-greasemonkey-script"&gt;The GreaseMonkey&amp;nbsp;Script&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one thing that initially bothered me about Trello was the time it took to add cards. At work every task I have is in either our ticketing system or
a GitHub Issue. Our previous official tool, &lt;a href="https://github.com/cmheisel/kardboard"&gt;Kardboard&lt;/a&gt;, synchronized with Jira so everything was always
up-to-date and on the right board. At first I was adding cards manually, but I figured there had to be a better way. A quick Google search turned up
a &lt;a href="https://github.com/danlec/Trello-Bookmarklet"&gt;Bookmarklet&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="https://github.com/danlec"&gt;Daniel LeCheminant&lt;/a&gt; of Trello, to add a Trello card for the current
page. It does some really cool stuff, like parsing Jira and GitHub issues and setting the card title nicely for them, as well as some other ticketing
systems. I also found a &lt;a href="https://gist.github.com/aggieben/5811685"&gt;GreaseMonkey script&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="https://github.com/aggieben"&gt;Benjamin Collins&lt;/a&gt; of StackExchange
that adds a link to create Trello cards from StackExchange meta&amp;nbsp;posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I took things a bit further and whipped up a GreaseMonkey script, &lt;a href="https://github.com/jantman/userscripts#trellocontextmenu"&gt;TrelloContextMenu&lt;/a&gt;. It
uses Daniel&amp;#8217;s card naming code (plus fixing the GitHub format a bit and adding support for &lt;a href="https://www.reviewboard.org/"&gt;ReviewBoard&lt;/a&gt; code reviews) and
the GreaseMonkey/Trello logic from Benjamin&amp;#8217;s script. Once installed and authenticated with Trello, the script retrieves a list of all of your boards
and cards, and adds an &amp;#8220;Add to Trello&amp;#8221; right-click context menu in Firefox, allowing you to add the current page to any list on any of your&amp;nbsp;boards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/GFX/TrelloContextMenu_large.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="screenshot of TrelloContextMenu context menu popup in Firefox" src="/GFX/TrelloContextMenu_sm.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The script is &lt;a href="https://github.com/jantman/userscripts#trellocontextmenu"&gt;available on GitHub&lt;/a&gt; (the link in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;README&lt;/span&gt; will go to an installable raw
version of the script), and uses GreaseMonkey&amp;#8217;s versioning capabilities. At the moment I&amp;#8217;ve only tested it with GreaseMonkey in Firefox, and I don&amp;#8217;t
expect it to work elsewhere as it uses a few GreaseMonkey-specific features, such as &lt;code&gt;GM_xmlhttpRequest&lt;/code&gt; and GreaseMoneky&amp;#8217;s browser-wide SQLite
persistent storage (to store your boards and lists, and authentication credentials, until you manually refresh). I&amp;#8217;d be happy to accept pull requests
from anyone who can get it working in other&amp;nbsp;browsers.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Trello"></category><category term="kanban"></category><category term="tickets"></category><category term="organization"></category><category term="work"></category></entry><entry><title>NSA Targeting SysAdmins</title><link href="https://blog.jasonantman.com/2014/03/nsa-targeting-sysadmins/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2014-03-22T09:38:00-04:00</published><updated>2014-03-22T09:38:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Jason Antman</name></author><id>tag:blog.jasonantman.com,2014-03-22:/2014/03/nsa-targeting-sysadmins/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Newly leaked documents reveal &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NSA&lt;/span&gt; is targeting SysAdmins - disturbing new&amp;nbsp;information.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I try not to rant too much, but I feel that this one was needed. If you&amp;#8217;re looking for
objective, technical information, skip this&amp;nbsp;one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was younger and more naive, I had near complete trust in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; government. There&amp;#8217;s a Constitution,
and they abide by it, and so do I. Since 2001, that feeling has eroded a bit. Since 2008, it&amp;#8217;s eroded even
more. But the documents leaked by &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Snowden"&gt;Edward Snowden&lt;/a&gt; have been
the &amp;#8216;icing on the cake&amp;#8217;. I know there&amp;#8217;s disagreement about whether what he did was right or not - I&amp;#8217;m pretty
decided on how I feel, but I know many others who feel that he should be taken out and shot - but one thing
that&amp;#8217;s no longer deniable is, since he released those documents, it&amp;#8217;s come to light that the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; government
is routinely performing unconstitutional acts in the furtherance of &amp;#8220;national&amp;nbsp;security.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel like many people, who said over and over again that it could never get to this point, that the
Government might cut some corners but they&amp;#8217;d never blatantly do things like &lt;a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/agencies-collected-data-on-americans-cellphone-use-in-thousands-of-tower-dumps/2013/12/08/20549190-5e80-11e3-be07-006c776266ed_story.html"&gt;mass collection of cellular data&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/nsa-tracking-cellphone-locations-worldwide-snowden-documents-show/2013/12/04/5492873a-5cf2-11e3-bc56-c6ca94801fac_story.html"&gt;tracking the physical location of cell phones worldwide&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/nsa-infiltrates-links-to-yahoo-google-data-centers-worldwide-snowden-documents-say/2013/10/30/e51d661e-4166-11e3-8b74-d89d714ca4dd_story.html"&gt;tapping into the networks of private companies like Google and Yahoo&lt;/a&gt;. It seems that
every new document leaked is worse than the last. I refuse to accept the arguments that this is all &amp;#8220;legal&amp;#8221;,
they simply don&amp;#8217;t keep up with the times. I couldn&amp;#8217;t care less if the government reads my postal mail (which
they still need an actual warrant for, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AFAIK&lt;/span&gt;) - they probably get the same credit card and siding offers anyway.
I do, however, care that the government - out of their own self-interest and excitement at near-effortless surveillance -
refuses to extend the same protections that wireline phone calls and postal mail get to their electronic and
wireless&amp;nbsp;equivalents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it came to light that the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NSA&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/12/20/us-usa-security-rsa-idUSBRE9BJ1C220131220"&gt;paid $10M to put a backdoor in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RSA&lt;/span&gt; encryption&lt;/a&gt;
I was astonished. Late last year a number of other deals came to light, where the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NSA&lt;/span&gt; paid or extorted software
and hardware manufacturers to intentionally introduce flaws in security to make it easier for the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NSA&lt;/span&gt;
to gain access. The worst part is these weren&amp;#8217;t &amp;#8220;master passwords&amp;#8221; available only to the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NSA&lt;/span&gt;; for the most
part, they appear to be mathematical flaws known to the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NSA&lt;/span&gt;, but just as easily discovered by our enemies.
This part seems to have been glossed over by the media&amp;#8230; the consequences of some mathematician
or security researcher discovering those flaws and selling them to a national enemy or terrorist
would be flat-out devastating to the country and economy. Our government deliberately put a flaw in
an encryption standard, and then used its&amp;#8217; influence via &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NIST&lt;/span&gt;, the National Institute of Standards
and Technology, to &lt;a href="http://arstechnica.com/security/2013/09/the-nsas-work-to-make-crypto-worse-and-better/"&gt;recommend that standard for use&lt;/a&gt;
including by banks, e-commerce sites and financial&amp;nbsp;institutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What has me even more upset, though, is the recent revelation that the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NSA&lt;/span&gt; is &lt;a href="https://firstlook.org/theintercept/article/2014/03/20/inside-nsa-secret-efforts-hunt-hack-system-administrators/"&gt;systematically targeting
the private, personal accounts of system administrators to gain access to their employers&amp;#8217; networks&lt;/a&gt;. The bulk of the information came from an internal classified blog entry of an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NSA&lt;/span&gt; employee,
&lt;a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.documentcloud.org/documents/1094387/i-hunt-sys-admins.pdf"&gt;available as a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PDF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
(or &lt;a href="/GFX/i-hunt-sys-admins.pdf"&gt;local copy&lt;/a&gt;). It&amp;#8217;s pretty technical, but it&amp;#8217;s also a startling view into
both the mindsets of &lt;em&gt;individuals&lt;/em&gt; within the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NSA&lt;/span&gt;, and the organization&amp;#8217;s overall goals. Just two of the many
worthy&amp;nbsp;excerpts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(S/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SI&lt;/span&gt;//&lt;span class="caps"&gt;REL&lt;/span&gt;) One of the coolest things about it is &lt;strong&gt;how much&lt;/strong&gt; data we have at our fingertips. If we
&lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; collected the data we knew we wanted&amp;#8230; yeah, we&amp;#8217;d fill some of our requirements, but it is
a whole world of possibilities we&amp;#8217;d be missing! It would be like going on a road-trip, but wearing a
blindfold the entire time, and only removing it when you&amp;#8217;re at one of your destinations&amp;#8230; yeah,
you&amp;#8217;ll still see stuff, but you&amp;#8217;ll be missing out on the entire&amp;nbsp;journey!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So&amp;#8230; ok, they&amp;#8217;re admitting that they collect more data than they want (or legally can?). This person&amp;#8217;s
blog series is about &amp;#8220;using passive collect to identify/enable &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CNE&lt;/span&gt; efforts&amp;#8221; (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CNE&lt;/span&gt; being Computer Network
Exploitation), which is also implying that they have access to massive amounts of data from non-target
persons, including American&amp;nbsp;citizens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within the document, multiple references are made to the &lt;a href="https://firstlook.org/theintercept/article/2014/03/12/nsa-plans-infect-millions-computers-malware/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;QUANTUM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
program which seems to be viewed as, in short, a tool that lets the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NSA&lt;/span&gt; input someone&amp;#8217;s Facebook,
webmail, or other online service account, and take control of the computers they use to access&amp;nbsp;it&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, for people in my line of work, the more troubling&amp;nbsp;part:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, fade off with me into dream-land. Pretend that we had some master list. This master list
contained tons of networks around the world, and the personal accounts of admins of each of
those networks. And any time you wanted to target a new network, you could just find the admin
associated with it, queue his accounts up for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;QUANTUM&lt;/span&gt;, get access to his box and proceed to pwn
the network. Wouldn&amp;#8217;t that be&amp;nbsp;swell?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(S/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SI&lt;/span&gt;//&lt;span class="caps"&gt;REL&lt;/span&gt;) Well, you can stop dreaming my friends, I think it&amp;#8217;s possible (at least kinda&amp;nbsp;partially).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So&amp;#8230; we&amp;#8217;re talking about deliberately targeting the personal accounts of innocent third parties,
in order to compromise their credentials to also innocent networks, in order to eventually
gain access to the information of a target. This seems so horribly illegal I can barely
explain. It&amp;#8217;s also a direct affront to the people in my industry who have an ethical obligation
to protect the data of their employers, customers and users against illegal disclosure. And,
maybe even more troubling, it&amp;#8217;s being perpetrated by other people &amp;#8220;in our industry&amp;#8221;, other
technical people, who obviously have a very clear picture of exactly what they&amp;#8217;re&amp;nbsp;doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first thought was to make an analogy between our resposibility as those &amp;#8220;with the keys to
the kingdom&amp;#8221; to a more legally entrenched privacy, like that between a doctor and their patient,
or between a lawyer and their client, that would be much more obviously illegal for the government
to breach. But, apparently that&amp;#8217;s an all-too-correct analogy, since it came to light last month
that the &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/16/us/eavesdropping-ensnared-american-law-firm.html"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NSA&lt;/span&gt; was intercepting privileged lawyer-client communications through the use of a
foreign intermediary, namely Australia&lt;/a&gt;.
Given the intelligence allicances between the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt;, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; and Australia, and the scope of what
has been already disclosed, I find it entirely probable that in all of these leaked documents
that discuss doing this to &amp;#8220;foreign&amp;#8221; entities only, the reality is that to do the same to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt;
citizens, it&amp;#8217;s as simple as logging in to the Australian or &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; equivalent&amp;nbsp;system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is truly disturbing to me. I continue to feel that (1) if the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NSA&lt;/span&gt; had provable cause to
collect this information, they&amp;#8217;d obtain a warrant like the Constitution says they have to,
and (2) their electronic data collection is the equivalent of wiretapping every phone in the
country and hoping for something useful - which has been continually held to be unconstitutional,
but because of the nature (already digital) of electronic communications, it&amp;#8217;s actually feasible
to&amp;nbsp;do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a related note, a while ago I enabled &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-based_One-time_Password_Algorithm"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TOTP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;-based
two factor authentication on a number of my accounts (Google, GitHub, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWS&lt;/span&gt;, etc.) to try
and keep them more secure against the possibility of a password compromise. Yes, that still works
to keep an unscrupulous person out of them. However, if &lt;a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2013/08/24/loveint-when-nsa-officers-use-their-spying-power-on-love-interests/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NSA&lt;/span&gt; officials use classified systems to
spy on love interests&lt;/a&gt;,
it&amp;#8217;s entirely possible that an unscrupulous &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NSA&lt;/span&gt; employee (or even worse, someone who manages to
compromise the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NSA&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s systems? Though I imagine they only use in-house-developed security for now-obvious reasons)
could decide to compromise an individual&amp;#8217;s accounts for personal gain. Given all this news, I
find it highly unlikely that such an event would ever be reported to the proper oversight authorities,
let alone become public knowledge or known to the&amp;nbsp;victim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, if we look at some of the information about what the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NSA&lt;/span&gt; is doing, like their
&lt;a href="http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2012/03/ff_nsadatacenter/all/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NSA&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s Utah Data Center&lt;/a&gt;
and their plans for an &lt;a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/01/03/snowden_docs_show_nsa_building_encryptioncracking_quantum_system/"&gt;encryption-cracking quantum computer&lt;/a&gt;,
and assume that they probably have a datacenter full of FPGAs, it&amp;#8217;s entirely conceivable
that they can calculate this faster than most people think possible. On the other hand,
if they have passive taps on backbone providers, it&amp;#8217;s also possible they can just hijack
a session with the click of a&amp;nbsp;mouse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t want to sound like too much of a nut. I&amp;#8217;ve never been terribly concerned about the
government snooping on my data because, well, I&amp;#8217;m not doing anything illegal. And aside from
my stance in favor of tighter controls and more electronic freedom, I&amp;#8217;m not in many groups
that I think would be targeted. However, I do feel very strongly about what&amp;#8217;s going on in general
(we already &lt;a href="http://www.marquette.edu/library/archives/Mss/JRM/JRM-main.shtml"&gt;learned&lt;/a&gt; that
government records on individuals&amp;#8217; activities can be horribly misused). Even more so, I&amp;#8217;m
deeply disturbed that &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; personal data and accounts could be compromised simply as a way
for a government employee to gain access to my employer&amp;#8217;s computer systems, and then to
those of our employees and&amp;nbsp;customers.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="nsa"></category><category term="government"></category><category term="privacy"></category><category term="security"></category></entry><entry><title>Blog Moved from Self-hosted WordPress to Pelican on GitHub Pages</title><link href="https://blog.jasonantman.com/2014/03/blog-moved-from-self-hosted-wordpress-to-pelican-on-github-pages/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2014-03-01T14:14:00-05:00</published><updated>2014-03-01T14:14:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Jason Antman</name></author><id>tag:blog.jasonantman.com,2014-03-01:/2014/03/blog-moved-from-self-hosted-wordpress-to-pelican-on-github-pages/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;My blog is finally migrated from self-hosted WordPress to Pelican on GitHub Pages.

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m sure this post will be &lt;a href="/2009/02/wordpress-installation-finished/"&gt;around in five years&lt;/a&gt; when there&amp;#8217;s a smarter way
to do all this, but until then&amp;#8230;&amp;nbsp;yay!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hit a number of bumps during the migration, mainly around &lt;a href="/2014/02/converting-wordpress-posts-to-pelican-markdown/"&gt;Migrating &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt; posts from WordPress to Markdown in Pelican&lt;/a&gt;
and migrating &lt;a href="/2014/03/wordpress-to-pelican-with-disqus-comments/"&gt;WordPress comments to Disqus&lt;/a&gt;, but in the end everything
seems to be working. Hopefully someone will find this and save a few hours or days of work if they try the same&amp;nbsp;thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Post-go-live I still had some issues - Disqus was displaying an&amp;nbsp;error:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were unable to load Disqus. If you are a moderator please see our troubleshooting&amp;nbsp;guide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;on all posts created after the WordPress migration, and FeedBurner rejected my attempts to change the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RSS&lt;/span&gt; feed &lt;span class="caps"&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt; to
its new value (though I&amp;#8217;m pretty sure that&amp;#8217;s because I neglected to drop the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TTL&lt;/span&gt; on the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DNS&lt;/span&gt; record, and I can&amp;#8217;t
find a way to tell Feedburner to purge it from&amp;nbsp;cache).&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="blog"></category><category term="wordpress"></category><category term="pelican"></category><category term="github"></category></entry><entry><title>Wordpress to Pelican with Disqus comments</title><link href="https://blog.jasonantman.com/2014/03/wordpress-to-pelican-with-disqus-comments/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2014-03-01T09:09:00-05:00</published><updated>2014-03-01T09:09:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Jason Antman</name></author><id>tag:blog.jasonantman.com,2014-03-01:/2014/03/wordpress-to-pelican-with-disqus-comments/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Solutions to some of the many problems converting a WordPress blog to a Pelican blog with Disqus for&amp;nbsp;commenting.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is the second part of my WordPress to &lt;a href="http://getpelican.com"&gt;Pelican&lt;/a&gt; conversion saga.
In the &lt;a href="/2014/03/converting-wordpress-posts-to-pelican-markdown/"&gt;last post&lt;/a&gt; I ran through some
of the issues that I faced when converting the posts themselves, setting up my theme and settings,
etc. In this post, I&amp;#8217;ll discuss the saga of moving from WordPress comments to Disqus&amp;nbsp;comments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be sure to read &lt;strong&gt;all&lt;/strong&gt; of this before trying it yourself, as I had some serious problems with my
first&amp;nbsp;attempt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="initial-import-to-disqus"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#initial-import-to-disqus"&gt;Initial Import to&amp;nbsp;Disqus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially, I installed the Disqus WordPress plugin as instructed in
&lt;a href="http://help.disqus.com/customer/portal/articles/466255-importing-comments-from-wordpress"&gt;Disqus&amp;#8217; Import from WordPress documentation&lt;/a&gt;.
The automatic import imported three of 134 comments, and froze there,
even though the status said it was 100% complete. I emailed Disqus&amp;#8217; support,
and was told that this meant the import failed (even though there was no explicit
notification, their admin &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UI&lt;/span&gt; said the import was successful) and I had to manually
import my comments. I did this, as instructed in the same docs, by disabling all
plugins except for Disqus and generating an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;XML&lt;/span&gt; export from WordPress, then re-enabling
the plugins, and uploading the export to Disqus. This time, I ended up with all 134
comments in Disqus, so I assumed that all went&amp;nbsp;well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="previewing-comments-in-pelican"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#previewing-comments-in-pelican"&gt;Previewing Comments in&amp;nbsp;Pelican&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I added my Disqus &lt;code&gt;shortname&lt;/code&gt; to the &lt;code&gt;DISQUS_SITENAME&lt;/code&gt; field in &lt;code&gt;pelicanconf.py&lt;/code&gt; and
re-built. I ended up having an issue with &lt;code&gt;SITE_URL&lt;/code&gt; being set incorrectly for some testing
that I did, so that killed 10 minutes. I rebuilt locally with &lt;code&gt;SITE_URL&lt;/code&gt; not defined, and
then used &lt;code&gt;fab serve&lt;/code&gt; to serve locally. I was using my
&lt;a href="/2014/01/planning-migration-from-wordpress-to-static-site/"&gt;Planning Migration from Wordpress to Static Site&lt;/a&gt;
post to test, as it was both the most recent post, and had a five comments in WordPress, which imported
correctly into Disqus and were visible both in the Disqus moderation tool and on the now-Disqus-powered
WordPress&amp;nbsp;blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I rebuilt with &lt;code&gt;DISQUS_SITENAME&lt;/code&gt; set and served locally with SimpleHTTPServer (&lt;code&gt;fab serve&lt;/code&gt;),
I checked the post and saw only a &amp;#8220;We were unable to load Disqus&amp;#8221; message below the post. It contained
a &lt;a href="http://help.disqus.com/customer/portal/articles/472007-i-m-receiving-the-message-%22we-were-unable-to-load-disqus-%22"&gt;link to their help article for that problem&lt;/a&gt;,
which pointed me at a domain mismatch/different origin problem. As indicated on that page,
I went to Settings -&amp;gt; Advanced in the Disqus admin, found the &amp;#8220;Trusted Domains&amp;#8221; box, and added
both my test domain (newblog.jasonantman.com - pointing at GitHub pages until I was ready to
shut WordPress down and actually move the live site) and &amp;#8220;localhost&amp;#8221; for testing, and&amp;nbsp;saved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I refreshed the page I was looking at, and now could see the Disqus commenting below my post,
but it wasn&amp;#8217;t showing any of the comments&amp;nbsp;yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Disqus commenting with no comments" src="/GFX/disqus_wrong_url.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I pulled up the source of the page, and saw in the Disqus javascript just below the post&amp;nbsp;content:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;            &lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;disqus_shortname&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;jasonantman&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// required: replace example with your forum shortname&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;disqus_identifier&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;planning-migration-from-wordpress-to-static-site&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;disqus_url&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;../../../2014/01/planning-migration-from-wordpress-to-static-site/&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Everything looked &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt; to me except for &lt;code&gt;disqus_url&lt;/code&gt;, which I&amp;#8217;d seen mention of on the
&lt;a href="http://help.disqus.com/customer/portal/articles/472007-i-m-receiving-the-message-%22we-were-unable-to-load-disqus-%22"&gt;help page&lt;/a&gt;
I&amp;#8217;d just been looking at. Sure enough, it indicated that the &lt;code&gt;disqus_url&lt;/code&gt; var must be
an absolute &lt;span class="caps"&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt; to the post, not a relative path. I assume this was because I&amp;#8217;d generated
the content without having &lt;code&gt;SITE_URL&lt;/code&gt; set, so I hand-edited the generated page to change this
to the correct &lt;span class="caps"&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt;, http://blog.jasonantman.com/2014/01/planning-migration-from-wordpress-to-static-site/,
and tested again. Unfortunately, still zero&amp;nbsp;comments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="wordpress-disqus-plugin-permalinks"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#wordpress-disqus-plugin-permalinks"&gt;WordPress Disqus Plugin&amp;nbsp;Permalinks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fearing the worst, I pulled up the same post on my now-Disqus-powered WordPress blog,
and took a peek at the source. The javascript over there revealed a&amp;nbsp;problem:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;disqus_url&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;http://blog.jasonantman.com/2014/01/planning-migration-from-wordpress-to-static-site/&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;disqus_identifier&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;1546 http://blog.jasonantman.com/?p=1546&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;disqus_container_id&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;disqus_thread&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;disqus_domain&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;disqus.com&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;disqus_shortname&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;jasonantman&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="kd"&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nx"&gt;disqus_title&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Planning Migration from WordPress to Static Site&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;While the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt; is correct, the Disqus WordPress plugin uses the WordPress
post &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ID&lt;/span&gt; and permalink for the &amp;#8220;identifier&amp;#8221;, but the Pelican plugin uses the slug.
That&amp;#8217;s a problem, as my Pelican site will have the same URLs, but the WordPress
post-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ID&lt;/span&gt;-based permalinks are gone (since it&amp;#8217;s a static site, and there&amp;#8217;s no easy
way of replicating things that are query param based). The WordPress post IDs
are thrown out by Pelican, so there&amp;#8217;s no way to connect the&amp;nbsp;two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even worse, I remembered that Disqus&amp;#8217;
&lt;a href="http://help.disqus.com/customer/portal/articles/466255-importing-comments-from-wordpress"&gt;Importing Comments from WordPress help page&lt;/a&gt;
clearly&amp;nbsp;stated:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imported comments can&amp;#8217;t be permanently deleted. Consider following our &lt;a href="http://help.disqus.com/customer/portal/articles/1053796-best-practices-for-staging-development-and-preview-sites"&gt;guidelines for development sites&lt;/a&gt; to make sure the data you&amp;#8217;re importing is correct. You can &lt;a href="http://disqus.com/register"&gt;register a new forum&lt;/a&gt; if you have imported the wrong&amp;nbsp;comments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id="solution-to-permalink-issue"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#solution-to-permalink-issue"&gt;Solution to Permalink&amp;nbsp;Issue&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not seeing any way around it, I figured it was time to &amp;#8220;bite the bullet&amp;#8221;. I disabled the Disqus plugin
in WordPress and then installed and activated the
&lt;a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/code-freeze/"&gt;WordPress Code Freeze Plugin&lt;/a&gt;
to disable comments. (&lt;em&gt;Note&lt;/em&gt; ironically, this plugin also uses JavaScript to disable your ability to
deactivate plugins, including itself. So before you activate it, copy the &amp;#8220;Activate&amp;#8221; link and save it
somewhere; changing &lt;code&gt;action=activate&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;action=deactivate&lt;/code&gt; will let you get rid of it if you&amp;nbsp;want).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disqus has some documentation on &lt;a href="http://help.disqus.com/customer/portal/articles/1104797-importing-exporting"&gt;Importing and Exporting&lt;/a&gt;
which includes &lt;a href="http://help.disqus.com/customer/portal/articles/472150"&gt;Custom &lt;span class="caps"&gt;XML&lt;/span&gt; Imports&lt;/a&gt; based on the
WordPress &lt;span class="caps"&gt;XML&lt;/span&gt; export format. So, I figured that I just had to decide that WordPress commenting would be
turned off, and do a point-in-time migration to Disqus (maybe circling back to hack the Disqus &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WP&lt;/span&gt; plugin
to keep comments working there for the time&amp;nbsp;being).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before anything else, I decided to actually set up a test forum/site in Disqus like they suggested.
I updated the &lt;code&gt;DISQUS_SITENAME&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;pelicanconf.py&lt;/code&gt;, and then started in on the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;XML&lt;/span&gt; munging. The
&lt;a href="http://help.disqus.com/customer/portal/articles/472150"&gt;Custom &lt;span class="caps"&gt;XML&lt;/span&gt; Imports&lt;/a&gt; documentation implies
that the import engine recognizes a &lt;code&gt;dsq:thread_identifier&lt;/code&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;XML&lt;/span&gt; element that holds the thread identifier,
but that element wasn&amp;#8217;t present in my WordPress &lt;span class="caps"&gt;XML&lt;/span&gt; export. It appeared that Disqus was concatenating the
&lt;code&gt;wp:post_id&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;guid&lt;/code&gt; fields (with a space in between) to come up with the&amp;nbsp;identifier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I wrote a script (&lt;a href="https://github.com/jantman/blog/blob/master/dev/wp-move/wp_comment_xml_munge.py"&gt;wp_comment_xml_munge.py&lt;/a&gt;)
using &lt;a href="http://lxml.de/"&gt;lxml&lt;/a&gt; that adds the &lt;code&gt;dsq:&lt;/code&gt; namespace to the WordPress &lt;span class="caps"&gt;XML&lt;/span&gt; export (unfortunately using
string replacement and a temp file, due to a &lt;a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/lxml/+bug/555602"&gt;bug in lxml&lt;/a&gt;)
and then adds the &lt;code&gt;dsq:thread_identifier&lt;/code&gt; tag to each post item, setting its value to the same
string as &lt;code&gt;wp:post_name&lt;/code&gt;, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt; slug (and post identifier in&amp;nbsp;Pelican).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I imported the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;XML&lt;/span&gt; written by the script into my test forum in Disqus and rebuilt the Pelican content.
Magically, the first time I looked, the comments were&amp;nbsp;there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, time to see if I could get the same effect with the existing Disqus&amp;nbsp;site/forum:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the Disqus moderation interface, delete all comments. You&amp;#8217;ll have to do this in batches of 10, as that&amp;#8217;s
   how they&amp;#8217;re paged in the interface. The comments don&amp;#8217;t seem to be permanently deleted, but do show as&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8220;deleted&amp;#8221;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go to &lt;a href="http://import.disqus.com"&gt;import.disqus.com&lt;/a&gt; and select your &amp;#8220;forum&amp;#8221; (site). You should see your existing
   (previous) import, as 100% complete, with the correct count of threads and comments. Do another import with the
   &lt;code&gt;_disqus.xml&lt;/code&gt; munged &lt;span class="caps"&gt;XML&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;export.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Comments should now be linked to the correct post in&amp;nbsp;Pelican.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, Pelican seemed to be working, but WordPress was still left with only the old internal commenting,
and that was disabled by the Code Freeze plugin. I probably could have manually patched the Disqus plugin to
reflect the new thread identifiers, but instead, I chose to just push forward with the switch from WordPress to&amp;nbsp;Pelican.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That only took a few hours, and I&amp;#8217;m happy to say that I&amp;#8217;m now up and running with a Pelican blog, hosted for free
by GitHub&amp;nbsp;Pages.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="wordpress"></category><category term="pelican"></category><category term="blog"></category><category term="disqus"></category><category term="comments"></category></entry><entry><title>Converting WordPress Posts to Pelican MarkDown</title><link href="https://blog.jasonantman.com/2014/02/converting-wordpress-posts-to-pelican-markdown/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2014-02-28T22:21:00-05:00</published><updated>2014-02-28T22:21:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Jason Antman</name></author><id>tag:blog.jasonantman.com,2014-02-28:/2014/02/converting-wordpress-posts-to-pelican-markdown/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;My adventures converting my WordPress blog to Pelican, the problems I encountered, and how I solved&amp;nbsp;them.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago, I
&lt;a href="/2014/01/planning-migration-from-wordpress-to-static-site/"&gt;posted&lt;/a&gt; about my
plans to convert my self-hosted WordPress blog to a static site using a static
blog generator. Since then, I&amp;#8217;ve decided to stop working on my exhaustive
&lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AnHh-ye5DNiNdF9DWkJrT2kzSkNsNVp6cjMzLXJ6VEE&amp;amp;usp=sharing"&gt;static blog generator comparison spreadsheet&lt;/a&gt;
and just try &lt;a href="http://getpelican.com"&gt;Pelican&lt;/a&gt; - mainly because it&amp;#8217;s written in
Python which is my current strongest language, comes highly recommended, seems
to have most of the features I want, and seems to be easily&amp;nbsp;extensible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I walked through the documentation for the latest version (3.3.0), started
a &lt;a href="https://github.com/jantman/blog"&gt;GitHub repo&lt;/a&gt;, and tweaked a bunch of
settings. The repo is public, so if you want to take a look behind the scenes,
see my &lt;a href="https://github.com/jantman/blog/blob/master/fabfile.py"&gt;fabfile&lt;/a&gt;,
etc. feel&amp;nbsp;free. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="initial-wordpress-import-attempt"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#initial-wordpress-import-attempt"&gt;Initial WordPress Import&amp;nbsp;Attempt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used the WordPress &lt;span class="caps"&gt;XML&lt;/span&gt; Export tool, as instructed in the &lt;a href="http://docs.getpelican.com/en/latest/importer.html"&gt;Pelican Importer documentation&lt;/a&gt;.
At first, I attempted to do a more-or-less default import from WordPress using
the &lt;code&gt;pelican-import&lt;/code&gt; tool, which writes rST, and then build the blog. What I
ended up with was thousands of errors complaining about &amp;#8220;Inline interpreted
text or phrase reference start-string without end-string&amp;#8221;, &amp;#8220;Explicit markup
ends without a blank line; unexpected uninden&amp;#8221;, &amp;#8220;malformed hyperlink target&amp;#8221;,
&amp;#8220;Unknown target name&amp;#8221; on all of my links, and a bevy of other Docutils
errors. It was so utterly awful that I gave&amp;nbsp;up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="wordpress-import-as-markdown"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#wordpress-import-as-markdown"&gt;WordPress Import as&amp;nbsp;MarkDown&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next I tried importing as MarkDown instead of rST,&amp;nbsp;using:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;pelican-import --markup markdown --wpfile -o content/ --dir-page jasonantman039sblog.wordpress.2014-01-11.xml
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;That built without errors, and the posts looked somewhat right out of the
box, without any of the previous thousands of errors. And the links looked
mostly right - even the captions for images. Though I&amp;#8217;m working at a Python
shop and writing a lot of Python these days, my knowledge of MarkDown is still
much better than rST, so this is fine for me. (I even wrote a &lt;code&gt;fab post&lt;/code&gt; task
that prompts for a title, generates all of the post metadata, writes it to the
right file, and opens up an editor on&amp;nbsp;it.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first problem was that the import script gave me one &amp;#8220;content&amp;#8221; directory
with 346 &amp;#8220;.md&amp;#8221; files in it - not exactly easy to work with. Luckily the
metadata was right, so a quick little
&lt;a href="https://github.com/jantman/blog/blob/master/move_wordpress.sh"&gt;bash script&lt;/a&gt;
moved the posts into a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;YYYY&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;MM&lt;/span&gt; directory&amp;nbsp;hierarchy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="obvious-problems-with-imported-posts"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#obvious-problems-with-imported-posts"&gt;Obvious Problems with Imported&amp;nbsp;Posts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After getting the MarkDown import working, and the posts moved to the proper
paths, I was still having some&amp;nbsp;issues&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="syntax-hilighting-gone"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#syntax-hilighting-gone"&gt;Syntax Hilighting&amp;nbsp;Gone&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In WordPress, I was using the
&lt;a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-syntax/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;WP&lt;/span&gt;-Syntax&lt;/a&gt; plugin to perform
syntax hilighting via &lt;a href="http://qbnz.com/highlighter/"&gt;GeSHi&lt;/a&gt;. The plugin uses
pre tags with a &lt;code&gt;lang=&lt;/code&gt; attribute to specify the language,&amp;nbsp;like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;lt;pre lang=&amp;quot;bash&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, these translated to some really ugly MarkDown fenced blocks&amp;nbsp;like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;~~~~ {lang=&amp;quot;bash&amp;quot;}
cp /boot/efi/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;EFI&lt;/span&gt;/fedora/grub.cfg /boot/efi/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;EFI&lt;/span&gt;/fedora/grub.cfg.bak
echo &amp;#39;GRUB_DISABLE_OS_PROBER=&amp;quot;true&amp;quot;&amp;#39; &amp;gt;&amp;gt; /etc/default/grub
grub2-mkconfig &amp;gt; /boot/efi/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;EFI&lt;/span&gt;/fedora/grub.cfg
~~~~
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;that seem to be just a bit off from what MarkDown/Pygments can handle. The
places where I just used bare &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;pre&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; blocks translated&amp;nbsp;fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;http://blog.gastove.com/2013-09-17_enabling_line_numbers_for_pygments.html&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fixed this by using fenced blocks with the &amp;#8216;lang=&amp;#8217; stuff removed, and in class
syntax like the MarkDown docs suggest. Some four-tab-indents with
:::identifier&amp;nbsp;work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="broken-links"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#broken-links"&gt;Broken&amp;nbsp;Links&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems that something in the conversion process introduced line wraps (could
it really be Pandoc itself???) Unfortunately, this wreaks havoc with any
explicit reference links
that use long (long enough to break across lines) titles, depending on where
they are in the line. It seems that in some places they end up breaking
differently in the link in the text and in the link definition, which MarkDown misses, and
then renders broken links and plain text of the link table at the bottom of
the page. Manually removing the line breaks and any extraneous spaces seems to
fix&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, yes, Pandoc was doing this because of the &lt;code&gt;--reference-links&lt;/code&gt; parameter
that &lt;code&gt;pelican-import&lt;/code&gt; was calling it with. There was an
&lt;a href="https://github.com/getpelican/pelican/issues/348"&gt;issue&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href="https://github.com/getpelican/pelican/pull/642"&gt;pull request&lt;/a&gt; to fix this,
but when I started with Pelican the last release was 3.3.0 (4 months ago) and
the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PR&lt;/span&gt; was merged after that. So, if you&amp;#8217;re having the same problem and the
latest release of Pelican is still 3.3.0, you might as well just apply
&lt;a href="https://github.com/getpelican/pelican/commit/83e4d35b44a422ee8d4b077f505970d03e555f45"&gt;the patch&lt;/a&gt;
yourself - it&amp;#8217;s just a very simple removal of a parameter in
&lt;code&gt;pelican_import.py&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="overall-results"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#overall-results"&gt;Overall&amp;nbsp;Results&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m quite happy with the overall results. I also spent a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of time manually fixing
markup issues that didn&amp;#8217;t translate well through Pandoc, but I suppose that&amp;#8217;s to be
expected given that many of my older blog posts had &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;issues.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="pelican"></category><category term="wordpress"></category><category term="blog"></category><category term="markdown"></category></entry><entry><title>Planning Migration from WordPress to Static Site</title><link href="https://blog.jasonantman.com/2014/01/planning-migration-from-wordpress-to-static-site/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2014-01-01T15:15:00-05:00</published><updated>2014-01-01T15:15:00-05:00</updated><author><name>admin</name></author><id>tag:blog.jasonantman.com,2014-01-01:/2014/01/planning-migration-from-wordpress-to-static-site/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Right now, this blog, my email, and a whole bunch of other services are

to date with administration and upgrades the way I used to, and
honestly, I&amp;#8217;d rather spend my time working on other things (like
actually writing all of the blog posts that I&amp;#8217;ve been planning to. The
first thing I&amp;#8217;ve identified for migration is this blog itself. It&amp;#8217;s
currently on WordPress and, frankly, I don&amp;#8217;t either need nor like it.
But there are some features I like. I&amp;#8217;d like to end up with a static
site generator, hosted from either S3 or GitHub Pages. I know that means
I&amp;#8217;ll lost comments (unless I move to a third-party, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JS&lt;/span&gt;-based comment
system like &lt;a href="http://disqus.com/"&gt;Disqus&lt;/a&gt;, which means I&amp;#8217;ll lose
&lt;em&gt;control&lt;/em&gt; over my comments) but I suppose I can live with that. What I
really want is something simple, static, cheap or free (that I&amp;#8217;ll likely
put behind a small ec2 instance running nginx for&amp;nbsp;redirects/rewrites).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m still in the planning phase, and trying to come up with a
feature-by-feature comparison of my options. I&amp;#8217;ll likely post that when
I finally have it done (at the moment it&amp;#8217;s in a very rough &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AnHh-ye5DNiNdF9DWkJrT2kzSkNsNVp6cjMzLXJ6VEE&amp;amp;usp=sharing"&gt;Google Docs
spreadsheet&lt;/a&gt;).
I&amp;#8217;m trying to round up my static site generator options and see which
ones will do most, if not all, of what I want (though I still haven&amp;#8217;t
discounted using hosted wordpress if it comes down to it). Here are the
features I currently &amp;#8220;use&amp;#8221; (have) on my WordPress&amp;nbsp;blog:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;User-defined permalinks to&amp;nbsp;posts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Overall &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RSS&lt;/span&gt; feed of blog (currently powered by FeedBurner) and of&amp;nbsp;comments)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Categories (a post can be in multiple&amp;nbsp;categories)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tags&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Category and Tag&amp;nbsp;pages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;per-Category and per-Tag feeds&amp;nbsp;(&lt;span class="caps"&gt;RSS&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tag cloud &amp;#8220;widget&amp;#8221; in&amp;nbsp;sidebar&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Themes. I actually like my current &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WP&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;theme&amp;#8230;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Visitor statistics (currently self-hosted
    &lt;a href="http://piwik.org/"&gt;Piwik&lt;/a&gt;, formerly Google&amp;nbsp;Analytics)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Post publishing via cron&amp;#8217;ed script (&lt;em&gt;see below&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Draft/Pending status (i.e. let me save a partial post, and let me
    save a complete post but mark it &amp;#8220;pending&amp;#8221; so I can just publish it&amp;nbsp;later)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Commenting (this will probably be the big sticking&amp;nbsp;point)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Syntax&amp;nbsp;hilighting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As &amp;#8220;weird&amp;#8221; as this is, I write all my posts in raw &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt;, and am
    perfectly happy doing&amp;nbsp;that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Subscribe via Email&amp;#8221; FeedBurner&amp;nbsp;widget&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;XML&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;Sitemap&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Twitter&amp;nbsp;box/widget&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pingbacks (not that these are really useful for anything other than
    spam these&amp;nbsp;days)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Automatic or manual post excerpts for feeds,&amp;nbsp;etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remote publishing via &lt;span class="caps"&gt;XML&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;RPC&lt;/span&gt;/Android app (not that I&amp;#8217;ve used it
    more than once or&amp;nbsp;twice)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Advertising - I currently use Google AdSense on my blog. The revenue
    from my tiny hit count isn&amp;#8217;t enough to offset the cost of a Linode,
    but if I moved to a much less expensive hosting service, it might be
    worth considering (you can&amp;#8217;t run ads on the free hosted WordPress,
    and I doubt you can on GitHub Pages&amp;nbsp;either).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should be updating this post when I do some more research and have a
comparison of the&amp;nbsp;options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note on &amp;#8220;Post publishing via cron&amp;#8217;ed script&amp;#8221; - sometimes I sit down and
write half a dozen or so blog posts at a time. But I don&amp;#8217;t want them all
to show up immediately, and spam the few people who still use &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RSS&lt;/span&gt;
readers after the death of Google Reader. So I set the posts to
&amp;#8220;Pending&amp;#8221; status, and I have a cron&amp;#8217;ed script that runs every weekday
morning and publishes the one oldest &amp;#8220;pending&amp;#8221; post. Who knows if this
actually does any good or&amp;nbsp;not&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="blog"></category><category term="jekyll"></category><category term="pelican"></category><category term="python"></category><category term="static site"></category><category term="wordpress"></category></entry><entry><title>Git Cheat Sheet</title><link href="https://blog.jasonantman.com/2013/05/git-cheat-sheet/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-05-14T05:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2013-05-14T05:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>admin</name></author><id>tag:blog.jasonantman.com,2013-05-14:/2013/05/git-cheat-sheet/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I use &lt;a href="http://git-scm.com/"&gt;git&lt;/a&gt; quite a bit these days, both with an

of some of the things that I usually&amp;nbsp;forget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Show diff of the last&amp;nbsp;commit:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;git diff &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HEAD&lt;/span&gt;^..&lt;span class="caps"&gt;HEAD&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roll back to version xyz of a specific file &lt;em&gt;(where xyz is a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SHA1&lt;/span&gt;
    commit ref)&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;git checkout xyz path/to/file
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Undo any &lt;em&gt;unstaged&lt;/em&gt; changes to your&amp;nbsp;branch:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;git checkout -f
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Undo any staged and working directory&amp;nbsp;changes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;git reset --hard
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Update submodules after cloning a&amp;nbsp;repository:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;git submodule update --init
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rebase on current master to pull in new&amp;nbsp;changes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;git rebase master
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rebase on current master, but for files that changed, take our
    version &lt;em&gt;(for some reason, a plain rebase seems to sometimes show
    conflicts on files that haven&amp;#8217;t changed in ages on master)&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;git rebase -s recursive -Xtheirs master
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Delete a local&amp;nbsp;branch:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;git branch -d BranchName
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Delete a remote branch from&amp;nbsp;origin:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;git push origin --delete BranchName
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roll back your branch to the same state as the branch in&amp;nbsp;origin:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;git reset --hard origin/BranchName
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revert a specific&amp;nbsp;commit:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;git revert COMMIT_HASH
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Track an upstream branch (i.e. in a project you&amp;nbsp;forked):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;git remote add --track master upstream https://github.com/user/project.git
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pull in upstream&amp;nbsp;changes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;git checkout master &amp;amp;&amp;amp; git fetch upstream &amp;amp;&amp;amp; git merge upstream/master
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Merge &amp;#8220;stuff&amp;#8221; from someone else&amp;#8217;s fork into&amp;nbsp;yours:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;git remote add other-guys-repo URL_TO_REPO
git fetch other-guys-repo
git checkout my_new_branch
git merge other-guys-repo/master
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prune local branches that have been deleted in the remote&amp;nbsp;(origin):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;git remote prune origin
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

It&amp;#8217;s a 1953 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; Navy instructional video about an all-mechanical fire
control computer. Yes, I really mean a &lt;em&gt;computer&lt;/em&gt; that can solve
continuously changing 25-variable fire control problems using only
mechanical means (gears, cams, etc.). Think about it for a minute - it&amp;#8217;s
truly mind-boggling. And really gives one an amazing appreciation for
the power of a simple pocket calculator, and the amazing engineering
that went into solving these problems before electronic computers. I&amp;#8217;m
usually not much of a math geek, but I watched the whole 40 minute video
and was in awe of both the simple ability to use three arms and a pin to
multiply numbers, and the amazingly precise engineering and machining it
would take to translate various rotation inputs into landing a shell on
a moving ship miles away. It&amp;#8217;s a really good watch, and will probably
leave you astonished by both how far technology has come (and what we
take for granted every day), and by the fact that feats of engineering
like this one worked quite&amp;nbsp;well.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="mechanical computer"></category></entry><entry><title>Pretty-Print a JSON response at the command line</title><link href="https://blog.jasonantman.com/2012/10/pretty-print-a-json-response-at-the-command-line/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2012-10-09T14:44:00-04:00</published><updated>2012-10-09T14:44:00-04:00</updated><author><name>admin</name></author><id>tag:blog.jasonantman.com,2012-10-09:/2012/10/pretty-print-a-json-response-at-the-command-line/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve been doing some work with &lt;a href="http://www.rabbitmq.com/"&gt;RabbitMQ&lt;/a&gt;

really handy little system tray application that monitors a
Nagios/Icinga instance and shows status updates/summary in a handy
fashion, including flashing and (optionally) a sound alert when

package for it, though there is an entry on the &lt;a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Package_maintainers_wishlist#N-O"&gt;Fedora package
maintainers
wishlist&lt;/a&gt;.
The closest I was able to find is a
&lt;a href="http://pkgs.org/centos-6-rhel-6/repoforge-i386/nagstamon-0.9.7.1-2.el6.rf.noarch.rpm.html"&gt;repoforge/RPMforge&lt;/a&gt;
package of Nagstamon 0.9.7.1, along with a &lt;a href="http://apt.sw.be/source/nagstamon-0.9.7.1-2.rf.src.rpm"&gt;source
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;RPM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the steps to build that package on&amp;nbsp;F17:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Download and install
    &lt;a href="http://apt.sw.be/source/rpm-macros-rpmforge-0-6.rf.src.rpm"&gt;rpm-macros-rpmforge&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As root, edit &lt;code&gt;/etc/rpm/macros.rpmforge&lt;/code&gt; and comment out the &lt;code&gt;%dist&lt;/code&gt;
    macro, so we&amp;#8217;ll still have the default &amp;#8220;fc17&amp;#8221; dist&amp;nbsp;tag.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;wget http://apt.sw.be/source/nagstamon-0.9.7.1-2.rf.src.rpm&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;rpmbuild &amp;#8212;rebuild&amp;nbsp;nagstamon-0.9.7.1-2.rf.src.rpm&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully this will help someone else as well. At the moment, Nagstamon
is actually up to version 0.9.9, so hopefully I&amp;#8217;ll build a newer package
sometime&amp;nbsp;soon.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="fedora"></category><category term="nagios. icinga"></category><category term="nagstamon"></category><category term="package"></category><category term="rpm"></category></entry><entry><title>New Job</title><link href="https://blog.jasonantman.com/2012/09/new-job/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2012-09-28T12:36:00-04:00</published><updated>2012-09-28T12:36:00-04:00</updated><author><name>admin</name></author><id>tag:blog.jasonantman.com,2012-09-28:/2012/09/new-job/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today is my last day in my almost-year-long stint as a System

desk this morning and came by a ripped-out sheet of notebook paper with
a handful of the interview questions written on it. Most of them weren&amp;#8217;t
terribly difficult, or terribly unusual for competent technical
interviewers, but since I happen to actually have the list written down,
I though I&amp;#8217;d share it. I don&amp;#8217;t remember why the programming questions
are all Python; likely, I was asked to choose between Python (which I&amp;#8217;ve
used, though not lately), Ruby (which I can barely muddle my way through
reading on a good day), and something else I don&amp;#8217;t know. Here are some
of&amp;nbsp;them&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is an inode? What does it&amp;nbsp;store?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is a hard&amp;nbsp;link?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is the difference between a hard link and a soft&amp;nbsp;link?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is a list in&amp;nbsp;Python?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Name some data structures that you&amp;#8217;d use in Python. Describe them,
    and tell me why you would use&amp;nbsp;them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How would you list all the man pages containing the keyword&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8220;date&amp;#8221;?&lt;/li&gt;

PowerDNS has separate authoritative and recursive servers, and doesn&amp;#8217;t
seem to natively support views or split-horizon the way &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BIND&lt;/span&gt; does, but
it has some really cool features including very mature database
backends, load balancing, Lua scripting support to modify how recursive
queries are answered, and geolocation or &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IP&lt;/span&gt;-range based query&amp;nbsp;results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this project is still just casual research, I thought I&amp;#8217;d share
some of the useful links and information I&amp;#8217;ve&amp;nbsp;found:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PowerDNS&amp;nbsp;Front-ends:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nicmus.com/community.html"&gt;JPowerAdmin&lt;/a&gt; - One of the two
    most popular, a GPLv3 Java (JBoss &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SEAM&lt;/span&gt;) based web &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UI&lt;/span&gt; with a RESTful
    &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt;, with support for &amp;#8220;multiple&amp;#8221; database backends. Sponsored by
    Nicmus, Inc. &lt;a href="http://www.nicmus.com/JPowerAdmin"&gt;Online demo&lt;/a&gt;
    (demo:demo). Looks nice, simple &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UI&lt;/span&gt;, but no support for&amp;nbsp;split-horizon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.poweradmin.org"&gt;PowerAdmin&lt;/a&gt; - the other most popular,
    though it seems to be undergoing a large overhaul at the moment. Has
    full support for most of PowerDNS&amp;#8217;s features, written in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt;,
    supports &amp;#8220;large&amp;#8221; databases, fine-grained user permissions, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RFC&lt;/span&gt;
    validation, zone templates. &lt;a href="http://demo.poweradmin.org/"&gt;Online
    demo&lt;/a&gt; (demo:demo). I don&amp;#8217;t really like
    that it manages the SOAs as full text (without any templating,
    dropdowns or default values), and that it doesn&amp;#8217;t prepopulate
    default values for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TTL&lt;/span&gt; in the new record form, but it looks like a
    good starting place for someone (like me) who&amp;#8217;s handy with&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://code.google.com/p/pdns-gui/"&gt;pdns-gui - PowerDNS &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GUI&lt;/span&gt; - Google Project
    Hosting&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt;/MySQL &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GUI&lt;/span&gt;.
    &lt;a href="http://www.powerdns-gui.org/"&gt;Online demo&lt;/a&gt;. Handles templates
    nicely but won&amp;#8217;t scale to too many of them. Window-based &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UI&lt;/span&gt; is
    visually pleasing but will probably be a problem for big&amp;nbsp;zones.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://code.google.com/p/powerdns-webinterface/"&gt;powerdns-webinterface - PowerDNS Webinterface - Google Project
    Hosting&lt;/a&gt; - A nice
    but relatively simplistic &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UI&lt;/span&gt; written in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt;. It has some nice
    features like multi-user authentication (and logging, though I
    haven&amp;#8217;t looked into how detailed it is), automatic &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SOA&lt;/span&gt; serial
    update, automatic &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PTR&lt;/span&gt; creation, etc. Unfortunately not geared
    towards people with lots of domains and multiple records; it has
    only one template for new domains (and no way to update domains
    created from a template), no easy filtering, and still treats &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SOA&lt;/span&gt;
    like a single text&amp;nbsp;record.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/zoneadmin/"&gt;ZoneAdmin |
    SourceForge.net&lt;/a&gt; and
    &lt;a&gt;Project website&lt;/a&gt; - Maybe not the fastest tool to use in bulk,
    but a nice, relatively intuitive and full-featured admin tool.
    &lt;a href="http://open.megabit.net/demos/ZoneAdmin/"&gt;Online demo&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;(demo:demo).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some links on PowerDNS&amp;nbsp;split-horizon&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://old.nabble.com/Split-Horizon-Scripts-td32843045.html"&gt;Old Nabble - PowerDNS - Split Horizon&amp;nbsp;Scripts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It looks to me that split-horizon is going to be the hardest part for
us, at least to also have a web &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UI&lt;/span&gt; to manage it. It looks like with
PowerDNS, the most common way to run split horizon &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DNS&lt;/span&gt; (views) is to run
two separate sets of servers or instances, either on different boxes or
multi-homed; one for internal and one for external. While that sounds
like quite a bit of overhead beyond what &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BIND&lt;/span&gt; does, the real problem is
finding a web &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UI&lt;/span&gt; that supports it; I don&amp;#8217;t care if it&amp;#8217;s in two separate
databases, but what I want is a logical (web &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UI&lt;/span&gt;) view that has zones
made up of resource names (i.e. the leftmost column in a zone file) with
one or two RRs (type, ttl, priority, value) - one for each view. That&amp;#8217;s
the real catch - all of our machines are in private &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IP&lt;/span&gt; space behind a
firewall, so I need to be able to manage the internal and external
records on one screen. While it&amp;#8217;s not exactly scalable, and the code
stagnated quite a bit once I got it to a point that was usable for me,
this was the main goal of my &lt;a href="http://multibindadmin.jasonantman.com/"&gt;MultiBIND

effort to combat this, I&amp;#8217;ve been trying to finish blog posts and then
set them to &amp;#8220;Pending&amp;#8221; status, and go back and publish one every day
(well, every day that I have some still sitting unpublished). Of course,
that counts on me logging in to Wordpress every day, which isn&amp;#8217;t
something I do. The following script is, at least for now, the answer
for&amp;nbsp;me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This script (a standalone &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt; script) uses
&lt;a href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/browser/trunk/wp-load.php"&gt;&lt;code&gt;wp-load.php&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
to load the wordpress environment, and then finds the oldest post with a
given status (&amp;#8220;pending&amp;#8221; in my case) and attempts to publish it. It only
does this if there has not been another post published in the last 24
hours. The following script can be found in Git at
&lt;a href="https://github.com/jantman/misc-scripts/blob/master/wordpress_daily_post.php"&gt;https://github.com/jantman/misc-scripts/blob/master/wordpress_daily_post.php&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="cp"&gt;?&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="x"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#8217;ll need to set &lt;code&gt;WP_LOAD_LOC&lt;/code&gt; (line 29) to the full path of your
Wordpress installation&amp;#8217;s &lt;code&gt;wp-load.php&lt;/code&gt; (it should be in the top-level
directory of your Wordpress installation. I run this script from cron&amp;nbsp;like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;0 6 * * 1-5 /home/jantman/bin/wordpress_daily_post.php --verbose # publish &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WP&lt;/span&gt; pending posts daily
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;so that it runs at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;6AM&lt;/span&gt; (local time) each weekday. Assuming you have cron
setup to send you mail, you&amp;#8217;ll get a daily message saying what was (or
wasn&amp;#8217;t)&amp;nbsp;done.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="cron"></category><category term="PHP"></category><category term="wordpress"></category></entry><entry><title>Interesting Systems Links for September 3, 2012</title><link href="https://blog.jasonantman.com/2012/09/interesting-systems-links-for-september-3-2012/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2012-09-03T09:42:00-04:00</published><updated>2012-09-03T09:42:00-04:00</updated><author><name>admin</name></author><id>tag:blog.jasonantman.com,2012-09-03:/2012/09/interesting-systems-links-for-september-3-2012/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Here is a small selection of sysadmin links that I recently found, and

&lt;a href="/2012/03/new-blog-theme/"&gt;posted&lt;/a&gt; that I was looking into open source
self-hosted web analytics tools to replace &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/"&gt;Google
Analytics&lt;/a&gt;. There were a few reasons
for this; most importantly, it started from a discussion with some
privacy-conscious coworkers, who said that they use
&lt;a href="http://noscript.net/"&gt;NoScript&lt;/a&gt; and specifically block Google from
tracking them (which also breaks Google Analytics). This was a serious
issue for me, as I no longer process server-side logs but relied solely
on Google Analytics for traffic information. So, I decided to try
something other than Google and ended up settling on
&lt;a href="http://piwik.org/"&gt;Piwik&lt;/a&gt; as my solution. I will say, in full
disclosure, that the amount of information Piwki gives is a bit scary; I
can watch users navigate this blog in realtime, and even the initial
dashboard page gives a list of the most recent visitors, with their &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IP&lt;/span&gt;
address, country of origin, browser, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OS&lt;/span&gt;, and the pages they visited.
However my decision was made on two main points: first, that I wanted
something withich could use server-side &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt; to log visits (albeit with a
lot less information) of people who had JavaScript or tracking disabled,
and second, that if &lt;em&gt;someone&lt;/em&gt; is going to have such amazingly detailed
information on my visitors, it should be me, so I can ensure that I&amp;#8217;m
the only person who has access to it and that it isn&amp;#8217;t used for the
wrong&amp;nbsp;purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside: The only revenue I get from this site is through &lt;a href=""&gt;Google
AdSense&lt;/a&gt;, which isn&amp;#8217;t a whole lot given the low traffic (certainly
not enough to pay for the hosting). Other than that, I keep this blog
to try and share my knowledge with others, and hope that someone else
can find the solution to their problem here instead of doing the work
that I did. So, I find analytics very helpful; I check my stats now
and then, go back and update or add to the most popular posts, and try
to write relevant posts if it seems like a lot of people are finding
their way here for something slightly different than the actual post
they landed on. Unfortunately, that last point isn&amp;#8217;t as easy since
&lt;a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2011/10/making-search-more-secure.html"&gt;Google switched to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTTPS&lt;/span&gt; Search for logged-in users on October 18th,
2011&lt;/a&gt;
- I can no longer use Piwik see the search keywords that got Google
users to my site. Luckily, these are still available through &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/"&gt;Google
Webmaster Tools&lt;/a&gt; (via
Traffic -&gt; Search Queries on the left menu), though it adds an
additional step and removes some of my motivation to check regularly
and make sure people are getting useful content. Also, perhaps most
importantly, it doesn&amp;#8217;t let me associate search query with other stats
like time on page, so even if one search query was very popular, I
have no way of knowing whether all those people actually read the
page, or took one look at it and&amp;nbsp;left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really like Piwki. I don&amp;#8217;t use most of it terribly often, but it gives
me a nice overview visits graph on the WordPress dashboard (via the
&lt;a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-piwik/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;WP&lt;/span&gt;-Piwik&lt;/a&gt; plugin),
infinitely detailed information (most of which I haven&amp;#8217;t even looked at)
in the Piwki web interface, and nightly email reports of visits to the
site. It also supports multiple sites, so I have it on my ancient
&lt;a href="http://wiki.jasonantman.com"&gt;wiki&lt;/a&gt;, my
&lt;a href="http://redmine.jasonantman.com"&gt;Redmine&lt;/a&gt; instance, and even
&lt;a href="/2012/03/adding-piwik-web-analytics-integration-to-viewvc/"&gt;ViewVC&lt;/a&gt;.
I&amp;#8217;d highly recommend it; it&amp;#8217;s full-featured (beyond anything I can even
comprehend,&amp;nbsp;really)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was recently looking through the stats for this blog, and came by some
unfortunate, though not surprising, trends. Below is the graph of visits
per day, from April 1, 2012 through today (August 26,&amp;nbsp;2012):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="blog visits chart" src="/GFX/blog_visits.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;#8217;s probably not terribly unusual for a site with as much technical
    content as mine (and mostly professional stuff, not just for
    hobbyists), my weekend traffic is usually a full 50% lower than
    weekday traffic. This can also be seen in the graph of visits by
    visitor&amp;#8217;s local time, which is decidedly biased towards the 9am-5pm
    window:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;img alt="blog visits chart by visitor local
    time" src="/GFX/blog_visits_localtime.png"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    I guess there&amp;#8217;s nothing I can really do about that, and it just
    gives me a nice maintenance window at 4am on Sunday mornings&amp;nbsp;:)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Looking at the overall graph, there also appears to be quite a bit
    of oscillation of the average visits over time. It&amp;#8217;s nothing
    terribly large, but at a guess, I&amp;#8217;d attribute it to my sporadic&amp;nbsp;posting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Though it&amp;#8217;s not visible in these graphs, this site has an 80% bounce
    rate (the percent of visitors that viewed only one page and then
    left the site). I guess that&amp;#8217;s also not terribly unusual for a site
    with mostly how-to information on a wide variety of&amp;nbsp;topics.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To add a little more information to some of the previous items, here
    is the chart of my &lt;a href="http://feedburner.google.com"&gt;Feedburner&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RSS&lt;/span&gt;/Atom feed, since I started using Feedburner in February. The
    number of subscribers is in green, and the reach (number of people
    who actually clicked through to a post) is in blue:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;img alt="Feedburner stats" src="/GFX/feedburner_stats.png"&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    This is a clear indication of something even stronger than the
    &amp;#8220;bounce rate&amp;#8221;; the apparently high number of people who subscribe to
    and then unsubscribe from my feed (if these stats are accurate). To
    me, this is an even stronger indication that what I really need to
    do is post useful content on a more regular basis - I have a
    tendency to blog in spurts, and either start a draft and never
    finish it, or write a few posts and set them to &amp;#8220;pending&amp;#8221; status
    with the intent of publishing them over a few days&amp;#8230; and then
    forget the last&amp;nbsp;part.&lt;/li&gt;

repository&lt;/a&gt;. Note that I&amp;#8217;m
developing against the &amp;#8220;develop&amp;#8221; branch of that repository, not the
master, so that throws in a little difference that isn&amp;#8217;t documented in
most introductions. To throw in another wrench, I maintan a branch with
the code that I&amp;#8217;m currently actually using (i.e. the application code
that I have checked out on the production server), called &amp;#8220;jantman&amp;#8221;.
This is more or less composed of the upstream &amp;#8220;develop&amp;#8221; branch, with all
of my finished (but not yet merged in the upstream) topic branches. I&amp;#8217;m
pretty sure all this is correct, but honestly, I&amp;#8217;m still new enough at
git that I can&amp;#8217;t make any promises. Unfortunatelty, I haven&amp;#8217;t had the
time to &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; learn git, and I also can&amp;#8217;t find a simple enough
tutorial that covers all&amp;nbsp;this&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fork the original repository through the GitHub&amp;nbsp;interface.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On your machine, clone your&amp;nbsp;fork:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;git clone git@github.com:username/reponame.git &amp;amp;&amp;amp; cd reponame
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make sure you&amp;#8217;ve&amp;nbsp;setup&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;git config --global branch.autosetupmerge true
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add your upstream&amp;nbsp;repo:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;git remote add upstream git://github.com/upstream_user/upstream_repo.git
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fetch it and initialize any&amp;nbsp;submodules:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;git fetch upstream &amp;amp;&amp;amp; git submodule update --init
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check the current branch (&lt;code&gt;git branch&lt;/code&gt;, let&amp;#8217;s assume it&amp;#8217;s called
    &amp;#8220;develop&amp;#8221;) and rebase to its&amp;nbsp;upstream:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;git rebase upstream/develop develop
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create my &amp;#8220;jantman&amp;#8221; branch, which will be the upstream &amp;#8220;develop&amp;#8221;,
    plus my finished work merged into&amp;nbsp;it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;git checkout -b jantman origin/develop
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create a topic branch to do some&amp;nbsp;work:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;git checkout -b NewBranchName jantman
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Periodically, push the topic branch to&amp;nbsp;github:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;git push origin NewBranchName
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you commit to this branch from another computer (or someone else
    commits to it), periodically update your local tracking&amp;nbsp;branch:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;git pull origin NewBranchName
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Periodically, you want to pull in the upstream&amp;nbsp;changes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;switch to the develop&amp;nbsp;branch:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;git checkout develop
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;grab the latest version of the upstream git&amp;nbsp;repo:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;git fetch upstream
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;rebase develop to mirror the upstream develop&amp;nbsp;branch:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;git rebase upstream/develop develop
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;switch to our personal&amp;nbsp;branch:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;git checkout jantman
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;rebase our personal branch onto develop (pull all the new
    commits from develop into our personal&amp;nbsp;branch):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;git rebase develop jantman
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we want those new upstream changes to continue down to our
    topic&amp;nbsp;branches:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;git rebase develop topicBranchName
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we&amp;#8217;re done with a topic branch, we want to merge it into our
    &amp;#8220;personal&amp;#8221;&amp;nbsp;branch:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;    git checkout jantman; git merge --squash node-table-facts
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;and then&amp;nbsp;commit:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;    git commit
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;--squash&lt;/code&gt; will squash all the history of that branch down to
one commit. This is generally easier for integration into upstream,
and assuming the topic branch was created for a single feature or
bug, should be&amp;nbsp;logical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we&amp;#8217;re sure we don&amp;#8217;t need it anymore, delete the topic branch from
    our local&amp;nbsp;machine:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;git branch -d topicBranchName
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;and from&amp;nbsp;github:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;git push origin --delete topicBranchName
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, make sure we push our &amp;#8220;personal&amp;#8221; branch back to&amp;nbsp;origin:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;git push origin jantman
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assuming all went well, you&amp;#8217;ll see the new commit on github, and
    have a nice pull request&amp;nbsp;button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

directory to grab the file from all 30 servers in question. Now, I&amp;#8217;ve
got a directory with 30 files in it, and I need to figure out how many
different files (by contents) there are, and which ones&amp;nbsp;differ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;find . -type f -exec md5sum &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;{}&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="se"&gt;\;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; sort &lt;span class="p"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; uniq -d -w &lt;span class="m"&gt;36&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will check the contents of each file by &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MD5&lt;/span&gt; checksum, and print out
the (lexographically) first file in each group, along with its &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MD5&lt;/span&gt; sum.
You can also strip off the uniq command, and see the list sorted by&amp;nbsp;md5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GUI&lt;/span&gt; alternative would be to use
&lt;a href="http://www.pixelbeat.org/fslint/"&gt;fslint&lt;/a&gt;, which is a graphical tool

Management for System Administrators&lt;/a&gt; were
infinitely helpful in the early days of my professional life, and are
among the few (literally, 4 or 5) books that live on my desk. His
insight and information into the soft skills of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SA&lt;/span&gt; work - time
management, hiring, working in teams, etc. - is not only excellent, but
also all too rare in a largely technical&amp;nbsp;field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, Tom posted the below article to his blog about a book that
recently came out, &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0195374126/tomontime-20"&gt;&amp;#8220;Taming Information Technology: Lessons from Studies
of System Administrators&amp;#8221; by Eser Kandogan, Paul Maglio, Eben Haber and
John Bailey&lt;/a&gt;. I
haven&amp;#8217;t read the book yet, and at $56, it&amp;#8217;s going to be a while before
my book budget recovers enough to justify it. But going on what I&amp;#8217;ve
read from Tom and others, I want it. Not only do I want to read it, but
I want to pass it around to my parents and in-laws and everyone else who
has asked what I do for a living, and I found myself at a loss for a
less-than-6-hour-long explanation. So, here&amp;#8217;s what Tom wrote on&amp;nbsp;it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Mom And&amp;nbsp;Dad,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many times I&amp;#8217;ve tried to explain to you what I do for a living.
&amp;#8220;Computer system administrator&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;sysadmin&amp;#8221; is a career that is
difficult to explain and I&amp;#8217;m sure my attempts have left you even more
confused. I have good news. Oxford University Press has just published
a book by 4 scientists who video taped sysadmins doing their job,
analysed what they do, and explains it to the non-computer person.
They do it by telling compelling stories of sysadmins at work plus
they give interesting analysis with great&amp;nbsp;insight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why did they do this? Because businesses depend on technology more and
more and that means they depend on sysadmins more and more. Yet most
CEOs don&amp;#8217;t understand what we do. The scientists made some interesting
discoveries: that our jobs are high-stress, high-risk, and highly
collaborative. We invent our own tools, often on the spot, to solve
complex problems. We are men and women of every age group. It is a
career unlike any other. These are things that most people don&amp;#8217;t know
about our profession. The book is very engaging: Some of the chapters
read like the opening scene of &amp;#8220;Indiana Jones&amp;#8221;; others like &amp;#8220;Gorillas
in the Mist.&amp;#8221; Kandogan, Maglio, Haber and Bailey have put together a
very serious, scientific book with care and&amp;nbsp;compassion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m not one of the sysadmins they studied but every story they tell
reminds me of real experiences I have&amp;nbsp;had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope you enjoy reading this book. I know I&amp;nbsp;did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pre-order it here:
&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0195374126/tomontime-20"&gt;http://www.amazon.com/dp/0195374126/tomontime-20&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sincerely your son,&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;Tom&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;P.S.&lt;/span&gt; In all seriousness, I read a preview copy of this book and highly
recommend it to others. You may have seen the authors speak at Usenix
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;LISA&lt;/span&gt; or &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LOPSA&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PICC&lt;/span&gt; conferences where they showed clips of the video
tapes they made. The book conveys the same stories, plus many more,
with interesting analysis. If you think that the profession of system
administration would benefit from non-sysadmins better understanding
what we do, I highly recommend you pre-order this book and share it.
You can pre-order it here: &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0195374126/tomontime-20"&gt;&amp;#8220;Taming Information Technology: Lessons

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have any interest, I encourage you to go out and buy the book. If
you know someone who&amp;#8217;s an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SA&lt;/span&gt;, you should buy them the book. If you can
justify any sort of book budget at work, you should buy the book. And
while you&amp;#8217;re at it, if you haven&amp;#8217;t read Tom&amp;#8217;s other books, you should
buy those too. You might be in the unfortunate position - like I am - of
probably never being able to implement most of his suggestions at work,
but at least you&amp;#8217;ll be aware of&amp;nbsp;them&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="books"></category><category term="limoncelli"></category><category term="sysadmin"></category></entry><entry><title>What I Look For When Interviwing SysAdmin Candidates</title><link href="https://blog.jasonantman.com/2012/07/what-i-look-for-when-interviwing-sysadmin-candidates/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2012-07-05T11:07:00-04:00</published><updated>2012-07-05T11:07:00-04:00</updated><author><name>admin</name></author><id>tag:blog.jasonantman.com,2012-07-05:/2012/07/what-i-look-for-when-interviwing-sysadmin-candidates/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I recently came by a question on ServerFault, &lt;a href="http://serverfault.com/questions/210218/listing-side-projects-in-a-jr-sysadmin-resume/405054#405054"&gt;Listing side projects in

&amp;#8220;side projects&amp;#8221; (running your own web and mail servers, freelance web
work, etc.) on your resume. Since I&amp;#8217;ve been interviewing candidates for
a few SysAdmin positions lately, I thought I&amp;#8217;d take the time to write
down a few of my ideas on this. Two disclaimers first, though. (1) I tend
to be pretty geeky, progressive, and very open source/DevOps focused at
heart. Not everyone I work with will agree with what I say here. As a
candidate, remember that you&amp;#8217;ll probably interview with all types, and
what I say here won&amp;#8217;t be the best advice with Enterprise types. I&amp;#8217;m very
open source centric, and have always held &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SA&lt;/span&gt; jobs where the majority of
the software I run is open source and not vendor supported. (2) If you
happen to actually interview with me, don&amp;#8217;t make the mistake of reading
this and tailoring your resume/responses to fit if that&amp;#8217;s not accurate.
I&amp;#8217;m not a manager, I&amp;#8217;m a line&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SA&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First, my response to the ServerFault&amp;nbsp;question:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not a hiring manager, but an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SA&lt;/span&gt; doing technical interviews and hiring
recommendations, and also have only been with my current employer for
7 months (so I&amp;#8217;ve been on both sides of the table recently). My
current employer is a pretty big company and pays well, so we&amp;#8217;re quite&amp;nbsp;selective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SA&lt;/span&gt; candidates with 5-10 years experience and a laundry list of
certifications, software and hardware names, protocols, etc. are a
dime a dozen. I&amp;#8217;m looking for people who really love what they do. I
have an instant bias against resumes that don&amp;#8217;t have either a personal
website/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt;, or some personal projects/experience other than 9-5 job
on them. There are lots of people who meet the technical
qualifications. I want someone truly passionate, and that means
learning and experimenting outside of&amp;nbsp;work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, on my resume, I have a few personal projects listed
(mainly programming projects and volunteer &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IT&lt;/span&gt; work I did for
non-profits), and I also have a link to my personal resume site that
has links to my &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SVN&lt;/span&gt; repo, and a bunch of other&amp;nbsp;projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some things I look&amp;nbsp;for:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not in all cases, but I like to see a website or blog listed on a
    resume. It&amp;#8217;s a big plus. I have
    &lt;a href="http://resume.jasonantman.com"&gt;resume.jasonantman.com&lt;/a&gt; with copies
    of my resume in various formats, as well as a bunch of links I&amp;#8217;d
    like employers to&amp;nbsp;see.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you&amp;#8217;re a working &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SA&lt;/span&gt;, I should be able to find you on Google.
    Either by name or email address, I expect to google the contact
    information I find on your resume and find at least some mailing
    list/forum posts, bug reports, or software&amp;nbsp;projects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I can&amp;#8217;t stress this enough, &lt;strong&gt;do not overstate your experience&lt;/strong&gt;.
    I&amp;#8217;ve been an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SA&lt;/span&gt; for 5 years, a hobbyist for much longer, and I&amp;#8217;ve
    never used the word &amp;#8220;expert&amp;#8221;. I list software, protocols, languages
    on my resume as beginner/basic, intermediate, and &amp;#8220;strongest&amp;#8221;. If
    you list something as &amp;#8220;advanced&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;expert&amp;#8221;, be prepared to answer
    expert-level questions. If you can&amp;#8217;t explain a 3-way handshake,
    don&amp;#8217;t list &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TCP&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;IP&lt;/span&gt; on your resume. If you list &amp;#8220;strong knowledge of
    Linux internals&amp;#8221;, you should be able to at least explain &lt;code&gt;open()&lt;/code&gt;
    and &lt;code&gt;close()&lt;/code&gt;. If you list advanced &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RADIUS&lt;/span&gt; experience, I &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; ask
    you to explain &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CSID&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WPA&lt;/span&gt; key exchange, and what attributes are valid
    in an Access-Reject. In short, don&amp;#8217;t say you&amp;#8217;re a genius in
    something unless you are; you never know when your interviewer may
    have spent the last 6 months immersed in&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All SAs should have some programming skills. If you&amp;#8217;re a recent
    graduate (let&amp;#8217;s say any time in the last 5-8 years) I&amp;#8217;d expect at
    the very least a vague memory of C++, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VB&lt;/span&gt; or Java. If you&amp;#8217;re a
    working &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SA&lt;/span&gt;, I expect to see either strong Bash skills, or at least a
    functional knowledge of Perl. Python, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt; or Ruby; preferably both.
    If you&amp;#8217;re a &amp;#8220;senior&amp;#8221; Linux &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SA&lt;/span&gt;, you should know enough C to be able
    to make sense of &lt;code&gt;strace&lt;/code&gt; output.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As stated above, non-full-time-job projects are a big plus. When I
    took my first &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SA&lt;/span&gt; job, the majority of my experience had been doing
    volunteer work for a non-profit ambulance corps (which I was also a
    volunteer &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EMT&lt;/span&gt; on). If I said that I did 40 hours a week for them, it
    would be an understatement. I wrote a few 10,000+ line &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt;
    applications for them, and designed the infrastructure to run them
    24x7x365. Small shop? Sure. But I learned a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LOT&lt;/span&gt;, especially about
    how to make things resilient enough that I didn&amp;#8217;t get paged&amp;nbsp;often.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m sure I&amp;#8217;ll update this over time as I distill more of my&amp;nbsp;ideas.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Emacs Mode Variable for HTML</title><link href="https://blog.jasonantman.com/2012/06/emacs-mode-variable-for-html/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2012-06-26T08:43:00-04:00</published><updated>2012-06-26T08:43:00-04:00</updated><author><name>admin</name></author><id>tag:blog.jasonantman.com,2012-06-26:/2012/06/emacs-mode-variable-for-html/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I often find myself editing files that are mixed &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt; and

and the indentation gets very messy, among other&amp;nbsp;problems.&lt;/p&gt;

tells emacs to load&amp;nbsp;html-mode:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also get emacs to do this for you, as per the &lt;a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Specifying-File-Variables.html"&gt;Specifying File

&lt;li&gt;Ars Technical is more or less &amp;#8220;mainstream media&amp;#8221; to me, but this
is a really interesting writeup on Facebook&amp;#8217;s release engineering
process, albeit at a higher level. Specifically, it talks about
their automation, phased rollouts, rollbacks, and how they release
the Facebook codebase as a single giant binary, sent out via&amp;nbsp;BitTorrent.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/monitoringsucks/blog-posts"&gt;Monitoring Sucks blog posts
    (github)&lt;/a&gt; - The
    &amp;#8220;monitoing sucks&amp;#8221; movement really speaks to me, having worked
    extensively with Nagios, Cacti, and similar technologies.
    Specifically, having rolled out monitoring in a variety of &amp;#8220;weird&amp;#8221;
    scenarios (a lot of monitoring devices or whole networks behind &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NAT&lt;/span&gt;,
    on dynamic &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IP&lt;/span&gt; connections, or otherwise unreachable from a central
    server), I&amp;#8217;ve felt a lot of pain in the current want of doing
    things. There are a lot of &lt;strong&gt;really&lt;/strong&gt; good thoughts linked here,
    especially the &lt;a href="http://jedi.be/blog/2012/01/03/monitoring-wonderland-survey-introduction"&gt;&amp;#8220;wonderland&amp;#8221; series by Patrick
    Debois&lt;/a&gt;
    and the &lt;a href="http://holmwood.id.au/~lindsay/2012/01/09/monitoring-sucks-latency-sucks-more"&gt;&amp;#8220;Latency sucks&amp;#8221; series by Lindsay
    Holmwood&lt;/a&gt;.
    This really got me thinking about my ideal monitoring system, which
    among other things, would integrate the &amp;#8220;alerting&amp;#8221; functions of
    Nagios with graphing/trending and correlation, would be based on
    some sort of message queue architecture (that supports multiple
    levels of proxies that could gracefully support &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NAT&lt;/span&gt; and multiple
    hops), and would be configured almost totally on the originating
    &amp;#8220;client&amp;#8221; (unlike the pain of distributed&amp;nbsp;Nagios/Icinga).&lt;/li&gt;

tool for small emergency services organizations, mainly aimed at
volunteer &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EMS&lt;/span&gt;/ambulance providers. The tool handles roster tracking,
scheduling, equipment maintenance and checks, and a bunch of other
administrative tasks. I first started it in 2007 for the &lt;a href="http://www.midlandparkambulance.com"&gt;Midland Park
Ambulance Corps&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;MPAC&lt;/span&gt;), which I
was a volunteer &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EMT&lt;/span&gt; with from 2005 through 2011. I&amp;#8217;ll admit that it&amp;#8217;s a
perfect model of how not to run a software project. The first few
releases are plain awful code. I was keeping the project in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CVS&lt;/span&gt; at the
time, and posted some early releases on
&lt;a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/php-ems-tools/"&gt;sourceforge&lt;/a&gt; and
FreshMeat, now &lt;a href="http://freecode.com/projects/php-ems-tools"&gt;FreeCode&lt;/a&gt;.
Sometime in 2009, I migrated the contents of the trunk of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CVS&lt;/span&gt; module
to a &lt;a href="http://svn.jasonantman.com/php-ems-tools/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SVN&lt;/span&gt; repository&lt;/a&gt;, but
discarded the history. I also setup a MediaWiki-based website for the
project, giving some information and mainly asking for feedback. Around
that time I started working on a new and heavily updated (fixed) version
for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MPAC&lt;/span&gt;, but since it appeared that there was no interest in the
project, and there were many many local customizations and
organization-specific features, I let their codebase diverge from what
was released, and as a result, stopped keeping it in version control.
Until now, when they need to migrate to a new server, and I&amp;#8217;ve also
gotten some outside interest in the&amp;nbsp;project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, as of this morning, I was left with at least four code&amp;nbsp;bases:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the original &lt;a href="http://cvs.jasonantman.com/cgi-bin/viewvc.cgi/cvs/php-ems-tools-trunk/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CVS&lt;/span&gt;
    repository&lt;/a&gt;
    with branches and tags and some history, untouched since&amp;nbsp;2007&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the &lt;a href="http://svn.jasonantman.com/php-ems-tools/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SVN&lt;/span&gt; repository&lt;/a&gt;
    circa 2009, with only 3 commits, all related to the migration from
    &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CVS&lt;/span&gt; to&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SVN&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a &amp;#8220;release&amp;#8221; tarball that at least one outside organization is
    actually&amp;nbsp;using.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the code that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MPAC&lt;/span&gt; is running, which has been largely rewritten
    since 2009, but also contains a lot of organization-specific&amp;nbsp;customizations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a first step, I created a new &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SVN&lt;/span&gt; repository and migrated the
original &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CVS&lt;/span&gt; repo, complete with history, branches, and tags, to it
using &lt;a href="http://cvs2svn.tigris.org/"&gt;cvs2svn&lt;/a&gt;, and then removed write
permissions on the actual module in the repository. This gave me a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SVN&lt;/span&gt;
repository with all of the history of previous so-called releases, with
a trunk matching r1 of the &amp;#8220;current&amp;#8221; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SVN&lt;/span&gt; repository. I then manually
applied patches to trunk/ for the two commits in the current &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SVN&lt;/span&gt;
repository, and set the svn:date revision property to the correct 2009
date for those commits. I also confirmed that the correct tag matches up
to the &amp;#8220;release&amp;#8221; tarball mentioned above. So, I&amp;#8217;m down to a &amp;#8220;current&amp;#8221;
trunk, plus the locally modified code running on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MPAC&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s current server.
My plan of action from this point is as&amp;nbsp;follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Move the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EMS&lt;/span&gt; Tools website from Mediawiki to my local redmine
    installation, and update the news with a link to this&amp;nbsp;post.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Migrate the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SVN&lt;/span&gt; repository, which now contains full history, to Git
    hosted at Github. Add Github integration to&amp;nbsp;Redmine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Update freshmeat, sourceforge, and anywhere else online that knows
    about the&amp;nbsp;project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Working in a git branch, begin converging the code &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MPAC&lt;/span&gt; is currently
    running with the latest (now git) trunk, trying to provide
    configuration options for anything organization specific, and
    testing as I&amp;nbsp;go.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If all works well, I&amp;#8217;ll end up with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MPAC&lt;/span&gt; running the current trunk, just
some different configuration options, and a working, up-to-date release.
The biggest issues are going to be how I handle the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MPAC&lt;/span&gt;-specific
additions and customizations (a lot of stuff hard-coded for our position
titles, plus our very custom call report and telephone-based call-in
software, which is pretty tightly linked with the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EMS&lt;/span&gt; Tools core),
and how I balance abstracting things to be configurable for other users
versus getting this all done in a reasonable amount of&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/p&gt;

the other day. It&amp;#8217;s a very detailed postmortem of the major outage of
the Windows Azure cloud service which occurred from 4:00 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PM&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PST&lt;/span&gt; on
February 28&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; through 2:15 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AM&lt;/span&gt; on March 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt;. Before I get into any of
the details, I should say that it really is a nice, well-done post. And
the fact that they&amp;#8217;re willing to do such a detailed, public postmortem -
and admit the failures that they did - is a step in the right direction
for Microsoft (a company that I don&amp;#8217;t particularly care for, to put it&amp;nbsp;lightly).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m going to glance over the majority of the post, though I highly
recommend that anyone interested in running web-scale services,
specifically highly available ones, read it. The general overview
(really just the points that are germane to my discussion) is as
follows: An agent running inside the guest &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VM&lt;/span&gt; instances (i.e. domU)
communicates with a counterpart on the host &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OS&lt;/span&gt; (i.e. dom0) over an
encrypted channel, authenticated by certificate. The certs are generated
and passed from the guest to the host when the guest instance is first
initialized, which means when an app is first deployed, scaled out, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OS&lt;/span&gt;
updated, or when an app is reinitialized on a new host. This cert was
generated for a 1-year validity period, by adding 1 to the integer year
- hence, the generation process failed on February 29th of a leap year,
as the cert end date wasn&amp;#8217;t valid. When the cert generation failed, the
guest agent essentially stopped cold. The host agent waited for a 25
minute timeout, then re-initialized the guest and started over. After
three of these failures, the host assumes there&amp;#8217;s a hardware error
(since the guest would have reported a more specific error otherwise),
declares itself in an error state, and tries to move its current
workload over to another host. Which re-initializes the guests on that
host, thereby causing a chain-reaction of failures in this case. Skip
forward the 2-1/2 hours it took them to identify the problem, and
further 2-1/2 hours to get a fix ready. They fast-tracked their fix to 7
clusters that had already been in the process of a software update, but
ended up with those clusters in an inconsistent state with
incompatibilities between the guest and host networking subsystems,
bringing down previously-unaffected instances on these&amp;nbsp;clusters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This whole scenario offers a few important points on both the
development and operations&amp;nbsp;sides:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inputs need error checking, and errors need to be raised.&lt;/strong&gt; So the
first problem here was the failed cert generation. I&amp;#8217;ll leave alone the
fact that, in my opinion, doing math on a the integer year of a date is
a high school or college programming mistake, and never should have been
made by someone doing platform coding for a major company (believe it or
not, 25% of years are leap years &amp;lt;/sarcasm&gt;). If whatever code was
generating the cert was smart enough to check the cert end date validity
and error out, that error should have been pushed up the stack to
somewhere where it could be handled - or, at least, sent to a central
log server that does error&amp;nbsp;trending.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Secure communications when provisioning need an insecure error path.&lt;/strong&gt;
This is somewhat connected to the previous point. If the normal process
of creating a new instance and communicating errors up the stack relies
on certs and authentication or encryption, there should be some method
of communicating errors with &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; process either up the stack, or to a
separate event correlation/trending system. Errors with a
certificate-based system are not unusual, and even something as simple
as a vastly incorrect time set on the guests could have caused this same
problem. In environments where management/control communication between
levels of a system are encrypted or authenticated, there should be some
way for lower levels of the system to deliver a meaningful error message
&amp;#8220;somewhere&amp;#8221;. Even if this is just a syslog server or web service that
listens for errors and can escalate a warning when the numbers spike,
it&amp;#8217;s a useful alarm and debugging&amp;nbsp;tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Autonomous systems shouldn&amp;#8217;t lightly assume hardware failures.&lt;/strong&gt; It&amp;#8217;s
arrogance for a host system to assume that just because it can&amp;#8217;t
instantiate new guests, a hardware failure exists. This entire incident
is a perfect example that, at least if hardware error indicators are
properly monitored, it&amp;#8217;s more likely for a software problem to be
falsely identified as a hardware problem than the other way around. All
of my points are somewhat related, but I can think of many more reasons
why a new guest can&amp;#8217;t be instantiated that are software-related rather
than&amp;nbsp;hardware-related.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Autonomous control mechanisms need historical trending, and need to
call for help if this looks wrong.&lt;/strong&gt; These host systems tried to
instantiate new guests three times, waiting 25 minutes in between, and
then declared themselves bad and tried to migrate guests to other hosts.
From what I understand, Microsoft got it right in having a &amp;#8220;kill switch&amp;#8221;
that prevented further migration of guests. What they didn&amp;#8217;t have right
was reporting of autonomous actions (guest migration) to a central
location that performs trending. The 25 minute timeout with three
attempts is a great safety feature, but if the status of guest creation
actions was reported to a central server, it would have been much more
quickly apparent that 100% of guest creations in the past, say, 10
minutes, had failed - across all clusters. I know plenty of shops that
do little, if any, real-time analysis and historical comparisons of
their log data. But when systems are designed to perform self-healing
and autonomous actions, it&amp;#8217;s imperative that these actions are tracked
in near-real-time, compared to historical averages, and that deviation
from a baseline is identified and escalated to&amp;nbsp;humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Release procedures are more, not less, important when the sky is
falling.&lt;/strong&gt; The extended downtime of the last seven clusters was because
of an improperly &lt;span class="caps"&gt;QA&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;ed update that was pushed out bypassing the normal
release and testing procedures. As a matter of fact, it was so poorly
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;QA&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;ed that the update totally broke networking for the guest VMs, and
was still pushed out. I&amp;#8217;m sure this was more of a management/executive
decision than one made by the actual engineers, but organizations (even
management) need to understand that when the sky is falling, services
are down, and everybody is stressed, it&amp;#8217;s &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; likely for mistakes and
oversights to happen, and this is when a proper, well-documented &lt;span class="caps"&gt;QA&lt;/span&gt; and
release procedure (including phased rollout) is &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; important.
Failure to follow these procedures results in exactly what happened in
this case - making an already bad problem much&amp;nbsp;worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; can&amp;#8217;t blame Microsoft specifically for all this (though the
whole thing would have been avoided if they just represented timestamps
as integers like the rest of us&amp;#8230;), but it is a good opportunity for us
all to learn from a major incident at a &amp;#8220;pretty well known&amp;#8221;&amp;nbsp;company.&lt;/p&gt;

is &lt;a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/inove"&gt;iNove&lt;/a&gt; (albeit an older
version with some custom modifications), and I feel like it looks a bit
messy and has gotten a bit cluttered, so it&amp;#8217;s time to find something
new. I like the 2-column layout, and have a few other things I&amp;#8217;m looking
for - specifically, aside from something with advanced features like
lots of widget support and hooks, something that has good visual
separation between different posts and widgets. I also really want
something, if possible, with relative column widths. My current home and
work desktops both have dual monitors, and the minimum resolution I have
on one screen is 1920x1080. When I look at my blog in a maximized
window, about half the screen width is wasted with empty space. So,
ideally, I&amp;#8217;d like a theme that&amp;#8217;s based on relative widths, probably with
a &amp;#8220;min-width&amp;#8221; property so it wouldn&amp;#8217;t get compressed to an absurdly
narrow width on small&amp;nbsp;screens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/"&gt;Google Analytics&lt;/a&gt; (as noted in
the &lt;a href="/privacy-policy/"&gt;privacy policy&lt;/a&gt;) for visitor statistics on this
blog (more about that in a moment). So, I took a peek at the breakdown
of visitors by screen resolution, and saw that for the past year, 94% of
the 27,500 visits had a screen width of 1024px or more (and the majority
of the others looked like mobile device resolutions, so they&amp;#8217;d probably
zoom the page correctly). So, my first gut reaction was to assume that I
could use a theme approximately 1000px wide. Unfortunately, there&amp;#8217;s two
main problems with that: first, as mentioned by &lt;a href="http://css-tricks.com/screen-resolution-notequalto-browser-window/"&gt;Chris Coyier on
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CSS&lt;/span&gt;-Tricks.com&lt;/a&gt;,
just because someone has a given screen resolution doesn&amp;#8217;t mean their
browser window (let alone the viewport) is that size. As a matter of
fact, I usually have my main browser window set at about 80% of the
width of one of my monitors, with my instant messaging client
&lt;a href="http://pidgin.im/"&gt;Pidgin&lt;/a&gt; taking up the rest of the space. So there&amp;#8217;s
one inaccuracy. There&amp;#8217;s a potentially much greater inaccuracy in my
stats as well, which I&amp;#8217;m going to discuss in a &lt;a href="/2012/03/inaccuracies-in-google-analytics-for-website-stats/"&gt;separate

trying to direct-market to my readers or become Big Brother, but for a
number of simple&amp;nbsp;reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;#8217;s simple - no software for me to update, and nothing that needs
    to run on my server and read through giant log files every night.
    Google does it all for&amp;nbsp;me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It gives a lot more information than I can get from just web server&amp;nbsp;logs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Because of Google&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;big brother&amp;#8221; tracking, and the vast number of
    sites that they track people on, I can tell things I&amp;#8217;d have no other
    way of knowing, like how long someone stayed on my&amp;nbsp;page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They tell me &lt;em&gt;useful&lt;/em&gt; stats like which search keywords brought the
    most people to my site and which posts are the most popular, which I
    keep in mind when writing new stuff and updating older&amp;nbsp;posts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They tell me information about client operating system and browser
    version, which I think tells quite a bit about my&amp;nbsp;audience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As far as I know, they&amp;#8217;re pretty good at filtering out anything
    other than an actual human&amp;nbsp;visitor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They tell me stats that have no real use to me, but are just cook -
    like what countries my visitors are from, what type of Internet
    connection they&amp;#8217;re on, their screen resolution,&amp;nbsp;etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously not for google, but for me, all of these stats are totally
anonymous - I just get percentages or numbers of visits, it&amp;#8217;s not like I
can see all of the details per-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;IP&lt;/span&gt; address. The most important aspect to
me is just the ease of use - I sign up and put a little snippet of code
on my pages, and I get an amazing dashboard interface with all of this
information. Nothing to install and update on my server, and (most
importantly, since I&amp;#8217;m now running everything of mine on one virtualized
server) no massive program to run as a cron job that has to read all my
server log&amp;nbsp;files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week I was talking with a couple of my co-workers, specifically
about the stats that I get from Google Analytics. While I know it&amp;#8217;s not
uncommon to run &lt;a href="http://noscript.net/"&gt;NoScript&lt;/a&gt; especially among the
more security- and privacy-conscious groups of people, I was a bit
disturbed to hear that they all block Google&amp;#8217;s tracking code in their
browsers via NoScript. I assume there&amp;#8217;s also a percentage of people who
still just turn off JavaScript alltogether (although I can&amp;#8217;t imagine how
they use the modern Web), and many who use the &lt;a href="http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en"&gt;Google Analytics
Opt-Out&lt;/a&gt; feature. So,
especially with as technical an audience as I have, I guess that means
I&amp;#8217;m likely missing a large number of visitors in my stats. On one hand,
I want to respect the privacy of my visitors, and respect their desire
to opt-out of advanced tracking. On the other hand, since I no longer
parse web server logs for statistics, these privacy-conscious visitors
aren&amp;#8217;t even showing up in what I think of as my monthly visit count, or
in my information on what posts and search keywords are most popular,
which I only use for &amp;#8220;good&amp;#8221; purposes - to make my blog more useful. So
that&amp;#8217;s a bit of a&amp;nbsp;conundrum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ll admit that I do run &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/adsense/"&gt;Google AdSense
Ads&lt;/a&gt; on my blog, and I&amp;#8217;m sure there are
some people who block the ads. On one hand, that upsets me a bit; I run
this blog to try and share information that I find or learn with others,
and the hosting costs aren&amp;#8217;t insignificant. If I can get paid to just
show some ads, to try and help offset the cost of running the site, I
think that&amp;#8217;s good. And if other people can help support the site by just
letting the ads stay on the page, why not? On the other hand, my hosting
costs $50/month (granted the server also handles all of my email, and a
&lt;em&gt;whole bunch&lt;/em&gt; of other sites). I&amp;#8217;ve been participating in Google AdSense
since March 5, 2010 (two years and two weeks), and my &amp;#8220;estimated
earnings&amp;#8221; are currently $80. The payout is in $100 increments. So, I
haven&amp;#8217;t seen a cent from it in two years, so I&amp;#8217;ve given up being
concerned with it. If you want to be nice, and find my posts
interesting, click on one of the ads. Unfortunately, unless I get
famous, the ads aren&amp;#8217;t going to come close to offsetting even part of
the cost of running the&amp;nbsp;site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google itself
&lt;a href="http://support.google.com/googleanalytics/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;amp;answer=55610"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;,
&amp;#8220;In order for Google Analytics to record a visit, the visitor must have
JavaScript, images, and cookies enabled for your website.&amp;#8221; There seems
to be some buzz about this on the &amp;#8216;net, and I&amp;#8217;ve seen
&lt;a href="http://garmahis.com/tips/google-analytics/#use-Google-Analytics-without-JavaScript"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="http://djangosnippets.org/snippets/2338/"&gt;number&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;amp;sl=nl&amp;amp;u=http://andrescholten.nl/google-analytics-zonder-javascript/"&gt;of&lt;/a&gt;
(translated; &lt;a href="http://andrescholten.nl/google-analytics-zonder-javascript/"&gt;original post in
Dutch&lt;/a&gt;)
posts advocating building a request to a Google Analytics &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GIF&lt;/span&gt; manually
on the server side, and then including it as an image element inside a
&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;noscript&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag in the page. While this is probably one of the nicer
solutions (and much more likely to reduce double-counting), it doesn&amp;#8217;t
capture any of the advanced data (screen resolution, etc.) that
JavaScript-based Analytics does, and more importantly, I imagine that
many of the Ad blocking extensions also block traffic to
google-analytics.com, so this is an incremental improvement at best.
There are also
&lt;a href="http://www.vdgraaf.info/google-analytics-without-javascript.html"&gt;quite&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="http://blog.datalicious.com/google-analytics-without-javascript-rss-xml-e"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="http://blogs.walkerart.org/newmedia/2009/11/12/building-walkers-mobile-site-google-analytics-without-javascript-pt2/"&gt;few&lt;/a&gt;
posts about how to make a request to Analytics purely server-side. This
has a few disadvantages as well; it bypasses the google domain
blacklisting problem that the client-side image has, but it also means
you lose the client &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IP&lt;/span&gt; address (and therefore geolocation), and that you
double-track any user who allows javascript (so you need a separate
profile, and then need to average out the results). It also means that
you track every search engine and bot that crawls your site, and
possibly every person who clicks a link and then hits &amp;#8220;back&amp;#8221; before the
page finishes loading. I found another blogger who &lt;a href="http://www.realityburst.com/battle-of-the-inaccuracies-how-accurate-is-google-analyticsawstatsstatpress"&gt;commented
about&lt;/a&gt;
the wide disparity he saw between Google Analytics, the
&lt;a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/statpress/"&gt;StatsPress&lt;/a&gt; WordPress
plugin, and &lt;a href="http://awstats.sourceforge.net/"&gt;AWstats&lt;/a&gt; (a server-side
log file&amp;nbsp;analyzer).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So what&amp;#8217;s the&amp;nbsp;solution?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the options have a down side, but I&amp;#8217;m looking for something
that&amp;#8217;s the best I can reasonably do. As much as I&amp;#8217;d rather not, I&amp;#8217;m
going to look into self-hosted alternatives to Google Analytics (a
self-hosted JavaScript-based stats provider), in the hopes that NoScript
users will be more friendly to scripts coming from my own domain, and
sending requests to my own domain, than ones from Google or other major
trackers. I don&amp;#8217;t think I want to try anything that parses web server
logs as a primary approach, as I don&amp;#8217;t think I could ever get a
meaningful comparison to Google Analytics or something else&amp;nbsp;JavaScript-based.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did have one other idea which I think is interesting, though a bit of
an overhead. I could have Apache (or, more likely, a Perl script called
in the Apache configuration) generate a random string for each request,
and save it in an Apache environment variable. The environment variable
would then be added to a field in the server logs, and also added (via
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt; or whatever else generates the pages server-side) as a custom
parameter for the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JS&lt;/span&gt; tracking code, enabling page hits to be correlated
between the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JS&lt;/span&gt; tracking and the server logs. Assuming the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JS&lt;/span&gt; tacking
backend stores its data in a sane format (and as raw data, not just
aggregated), and at the cost of a serious performance penalty, a
server-side statistics program like
&lt;a href="http://awstats.sourceforge.net/"&gt;AWstats&lt;/a&gt; or
&lt;a href="http://www.webalizer.org/"&gt;Webalizer&lt;/a&gt; could be patched to lookup the
unique identifier in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JS&lt;/span&gt; stats data store, and ignore all hits which
were tracked that&amp;nbsp;way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m going to start by looking into self-hosted open source alternatives
to Google Analytics, which I&amp;#8217;ll post about sometime hopefully&amp;nbsp;soon.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="analytics"></category><category term="google"></category><category term="logging"></category><category term="statistics"></category><category term="stats"></category></entry><entry><title>World of Warcraft Realm Status Check Plugin for Nagios</title><link href="https://blog.jasonantman.com/2012/03/world-of-warcraft-realm-status-check-plugin-for-nagios/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2012-03-16T07:40:00-04:00</published><updated>2012-03-16T07:40:00-04:00</updated><author><name>admin</name></author><id>tag:blog.jasonantman.com,2012-03-16:/2012/03/world-of-warcraft-realm-status-check-plugin-for-nagios/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;My wife &lt;a href="http://www.jackieantman.com/"&gt;Jackie&lt;/a&gt;

on Nagios Exchange, but it was written to a now-discontinued &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt;. It was
also last modified in 2008, and I can&amp;#8217;t seem to get in contact with the
author, Scott A&amp;#8217;Hearn (webmaster@scottahearn.com) - that email returns
undeliverable, there&amp;#8217;s no email link on the site that his domain now

interesting talk from Paul Fenwick. Yes, it&amp;#8217;s from a techie conference
(&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wetware_(brain)"&gt;wetware&lt;/a&gt; == the brain),
but it&amp;#8217;s mostly psychology-based, and covers some &lt;span class="caps"&gt;REALLY&lt;/span&gt; interesting

how the brain is manipulated in advertising and&amp;nbsp;otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;

of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RIM&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s infrastructure in their 12-year history, it&amp;#8217;s also a wonderful
case&amp;nbsp;study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently the outage started Monday morning with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RIM&lt;/span&gt; infrastructure in
Europe, the Middle East and Asia. However, by Wednesday, it had become a
global outage/slowdown of BlackBerry infrastructure (specifically the
parts that go through &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RIM&lt;/span&gt; - email, web browsing, and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BBM&lt;/span&gt;; voice calls
and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SMS&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;MMS&lt;/span&gt; were unaffected). With BlackBerry&amp;#8217;s market share falling,
Android&amp;#8217;s rapidly growing (and Android slowly becoming a viable
enterprise option), and the launch of the iPhone 4S just around the
corner, the timing of this couldn&amp;#8217;t be worse for&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;RIM&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;RIM&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s original
&lt;a href="http://www.rim.com/newsroom/service-update.shtml"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; about the
problem, at 21:30 on Tuesday October 11th,&amp;nbsp;was,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The messaging and browsing delays that some of you are still
experiencing were caused by a core switch failure within &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RIM&lt;/span&gt;’s
infrastructure. Although the system is designed to failover to a
back-up switch, the failover did not function as previously tested. As
a result, a large backlog of data was generated and we are now working
to clear that backlog and restore normal service as quickly as
possible. We sincerely apologise for the inconvenience caused to many
of you and we will continue to keep you&amp;nbsp;informed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;#8217;t been able to find much more technical information than that -
a &lt;a href="http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9220736/RIM_global_outage_caused_by_core_switch_failure_fix_under_way"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CNET&lt;/span&gt; article from
Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;
goes into as much depth as anything I could find. I did find one mention
(misplaced the link) that the core switch in question uses technology
from &amp;#8220;multiple vendors&amp;#8221;. So what follows is part common sense (for me&amp;#8230;
why not for a multi-national corporation?) and part speculation. If
you&amp;#8217;re unfamiliar with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RIM&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s architecture, the pertinent points are that
all Internet-bound traffic (browsing, email, and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BBM&lt;/span&gt;) is piped through
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;RIM&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s data centers, where it&amp;#8217;s encypted and who-knows-what-else&amp;#8217;ed
(perhaps
&lt;a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970204612504576608561811929654.html"&gt;monitored&lt;/a&gt;)
before going back out onto the &amp;#8216;net. In the Enterprise market, their big
claim is encryption/security, and monitoring/management/policy
enforcement on&amp;nbsp;handsets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First main point: &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RIM&lt;/span&gt; is a &lt;em&gt;big&lt;/em&gt; company. The thought that they rely on
an (apparently custom) core switch - a &lt;em&gt;single&lt;/em&gt; core switch for multiple
&lt;em&gt;continents&lt;/em&gt; - is amazing. It&amp;#8217;s even more amazing that they&amp;#8217;d let such a
large part of their infrastructure ride on an architecture with,
apparently, an untested failover mechanism. Of course I don&amp;#8217;t know all
the details, but I&amp;#8217;d hope that for a single piece of hardware which is
so critical, they&amp;#8217;d a) have a cold spare physically nearby so a
replacement wouldn&amp;#8217;t take a day or two, and b) if they can&amp;#8217;t do an
online failover test, at least have a full lab environment to test the
failover&amp;nbsp;in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second main point: Their big claim through all of this is that they
didn&amp;#8217;t lose any data - email, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BBM&lt;/span&gt;, etc. - it just got delayed. So if
there was a core switch failure in their data center serving &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EMEA&lt;/span&gt;, and
the next day global services slowed to a crawl, the only thing that
comes to mind to me is a waterfall; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EMEA&lt;/span&gt; went down, and they started
rerouting traffic to their North America data center. The increased load
- probably a disaster recovery plan they never truly tested or even
planned - brought everything to a screeching halt, and caused them to
resort to simply caching messaging and pushing it out bit by bit as the
infrastructure could handle.&amp;nbsp;Oops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what are my (admittedly poorly-informed) thoughts on&amp;nbsp;this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scaling out works. Scaling up - especially with single points of
    failure, or N+1 redundancy - is dangerous. If &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RIM&lt;/span&gt; had scaled out and
    used regional data centers, with a close-to-commodity core and as
    much redundancy as possible, this wouldn&amp;#8217;t have happened. Sure,
    infrastructure costs money. But if that one &amp;#8220;core switch&amp;#8221; had been
    1,000 devices spread across multiple racks in multiple data centers,
    this never would have happened. And the devices would be
    comparatively cheap enough to probably keep spares on hand too. And
    regularly test their failover procedures. To all of the big
    businesses (apparently like &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RIM&lt;/span&gt;) who still think that big iron is
    the only way to do things right&amp;#8230; maybe it&amp;#8217;s time to take a hard
    look at that, and compare your architecture to that of the modern,
    new, hip giants like Google and Facebook. Grids and clusters. Nodes
    that can fail without anyone blinking. Scaling out might not fix
    every problem, but having half the world on a single core switch
    with N+1 redundancy probably isn&amp;#8217;t smart&amp;nbsp;either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disasters need to be planned for. Every possible contingency needs
    to be planned for. Plans need to be tested, regularly. If your giant
    core switch goes down and the failover doesn&amp;#8217;t &amp;#8220;function as
    previously tested&amp;#8221;, there&amp;#8217;s a serious problem both in your disaster
    planning, and in your validation and test procedure. If you have
    half of your customer base riding on a failover plan that isn&amp;#8217;t
    &lt;em&gt;regularly&lt;/em&gt; tested or otherwise validated, that&amp;#8217;s bad. While I can
    argue that the whole architecture - given this massive point of
    failure - could stand to be re-thought, the real issue here is with
    test/validation methodologies and procedures. For a company with 70
    million users, having a piece of infrastructure this critical fail,
    and the failover &amp;#8216;not work as tested&amp;#8217; is a very serious&amp;nbsp;issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Damage control is important. As I said, I can only imagine that the
    severe service degradation outside of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EMEA&lt;/span&gt; was due to rerouting data
    from &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EMEA&lt;/span&gt; to the remaining functional data center(s). Such a
    solution should only be considered if it has been tested, or at
    least has engineering validation. If it was part of the disaster
    recovery plan, it obviously isn&amp;#8217;t actually a suitable solution, and
    served only to increase the scope of the outage. If it wasn&amp;#8217;t part
    of the disaster recovery plan, and was decided on-the-fly, someone
    really didn&amp;#8217;t do their research and engineering before putting the
    fix in place. A workable solution should have been planned ahead of
    time. And if one wasn&amp;#8217;t, it&amp;#8217;s very bad practice - this outage shows
    the results - to put in place a fix that hasn&amp;#8217;t been thought&amp;nbsp;out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a company whose business is so telecom-focused, this seems like a
glaringly bad design that shouldn&amp;#8217;t be acceptable in a&amp;nbsp;telecom.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="blackberry"></category><category term="outage"></category></entry><entry><title>Article on theInquirer.net</title><link href="https://blog.jasonantman.com/2011/07/article-on-theinquirer-net/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-07-11T15:55:00-04:00</published><updated>2011-07-11T15:55:00-04:00</updated><author><name>admin</name></author><id>tag:blog.jasonantman.com,2011-07-11:/2011/07/article-on-theinquirer-net/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I guess it&amp;#8217;s pretty strange that I just found out about it now, three

&lt;a href="http://www.mint.com"&gt;Mint.com&lt;/a&gt;, it&amp;#8217;s a free online personal finance
site that allows you to track spending across all of your bank accounts
and manage budgets and financial goals. Once upon a time it was a nice
little Web 2.0 startup, now it&amp;#8217;s owned by Intuit. The service is free,
but it&amp;#8217;s ad supported, albeit in an unintrusive way - &amp;#8220;partner&amp;#8221; services
(credit cards, savings accounts, etc.) are recommended. I&amp;#8217;ve been using
it for about two weeks now, with a goal of tracking my spending,
developing a budget and getting a better handle on my present and future
finances. So here are some of my impressions, considering that the
service is still growing but has been around for a&amp;nbsp;while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The&amp;nbsp;Good:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Account Sync&lt;/strong&gt; - Some things I&amp;#8217;ve read online suggest that Mint
    now uses the &lt;a href="http://yodlee.com"&gt;Yodlee&lt;/a&gt; service to sync
    transactions from your financial institutions. Whatever they use,
    they seem to be able to sync transactions and account balances from
    all of my accounts, even ones at a few small investment companies.
    The sync is fast, and they do push notifications (low balance, large
    deposits, etc.) very well. They even seem to support many more
    institutions than Quicken last time I used it (2010 I&amp;nbsp;think).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Budgets&lt;/strong&gt; - Mint has a very nice, clean, simple monthly budget
    implementation. You tell it how much you want to spend in a given
    category in a month, and it shows a nice horizontal bar graph of how
    far through your allotment you are. It even makes some suggestions,
    and sets baseline budgets by category based on previous spending.
    About the only problem is when my bi-weely pay checks fall on odd
    weeks in the month. Most of my bills are due near the end of the
    month, and if my pay check happens to be around the same time my
    bills are due, I&amp;#8217;ll have quite a bit less cash on hand at the
    beginning of the next month than the budgets&amp;nbsp;reflect.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Categorization&lt;/strong&gt; - they do it very well. One of their big selling
    points is their categorization engine, and it seemed to get about
    80% of my purchases right, from day one. That&amp;#8217;s much better than
    anything else I&amp;#8217;ve seen. The only down side is that they only look
    at the Vendor name, not the description - so when I use my debit
    card and the vendor name is &amp;#8220;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NYCE&lt;/span&gt; Transaction&amp;#8221; but the store
    name/address is in the description, Mint is hopelessly lost. They
    offer rules to put transactions in category, but only exact matching
    on the vendor name, so there&amp;#8217;s no way to tell it to look at a
    description that includes &amp;#8220;123 Main St&amp;#8221;. From a programmer&amp;#8217;s
    perspective, they should allow rules based on either vendor name
    &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; description, and maybe they should let the user highlight or
    specify the part that matches (or a&amp;nbsp;RegEx?).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apps&lt;/strong&gt; - I haven&amp;#8217;t tried the iOS ones, but the Android app is
    pretty nice. It gives a nice quick picture of your spending and
    account balances, how you&amp;#8217;re doing with your monthly budget, and any
    alerts/messages. Transaction history isn&amp;#8217;t easily accessible and is
    per-account only, so it&amp;#8217;s hard to answer &amp;#8220;hmmm, how much did it cost
    last time I was here?&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;where did I get lunch last Tuesday?&amp;#8221;, but
    it&amp;#8217;s still handy enough to tell me how much I have left in my
    Entertainment budget, or whether I should put this big purchase on
    my credit or debit&amp;nbsp;card.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Goals&lt;/strong&gt; - Mint has a good idea with goals - it includes a number
    of pre-configured financial goals like paying off credit card debt,
    saving for retirement, or stashing away some emergency cash. But in
    order to function correctly, you must have a specific, dedicated
    account for each goal. I guess this is where Mint makes money - they
    suggest accounts with specific attributes (high interest, high
    liquidity, whatever) from their partners. But there doesn&amp;#8217;t appear
    to be a way to set up a Goal without associating it with a dedicated
    account, and (as per some forum posts I read, I haven&amp;#8217;t tried this)
    you can&amp;#8217;t associate a cash asset account with a goal, so there&amp;#8217;s no
    way to track my progress on building the Depression fund I keep
    under my&amp;nbsp;mattress.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Bad/Room for&amp;nbsp;Improvement:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Customer Service&lt;/strong&gt; - I don&amp;#8217;t know when Mint was bought up by
    Intuit, but to me, they have the feel of an agile Web 2.0 property
    that was bought up by a slow-moving bureaucratic company unable to
    keep up with customer demands or the amount of support requests.
    They use &lt;a href="http://getsatisfaction.com/"&gt;GetSatisfaction&lt;/a&gt;, a new-age
    forum-based customer &amp;#8220;community&amp;#8221; provider, for customer service. But
    their forums are filled with feature request threads that have
    &amp;#8220;we&amp;#8217;ll bring it up to Product Development and get back to you&amp;#8221;
    responses over half a year old. There appears to be very little
    follow-through or feedback on feature requests, and poor
    announcement/communication surrounding the one feature that was
    recently brought in to an invitation-only beta. Unfortunately, I get
    the general feeling (and I&amp;#8217;ve found this far too many times lately)
    that they were originally a cutting-edge, agile, fast-paced, &amp;#8220;cool&amp;#8221;
    service, developed by a team that probably stayed up all night
    coding a cool feature their users were asking for, that&amp;#8217;s now been
    swallowed up by a behemoth that wants a 6-month-long risk assessment
    before writing a line of&amp;nbsp;code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cash Tracking&lt;/strong&gt; - I understand that Mint makes money from
    recommending the services of lenders, banks, etc. But if you want to
    monetize every single feature, you&amp;#8217;re bound to fail. In this
    respect, Mint&amp;#8217;s total lack of cash accounting is a serious failure
    for many of their users (and the forums are filled with threads to
    this effect). The site allows users to manually input cash
    transactions, but that&amp;#8217;s about it. You can deduct the amount from an
    automatically-synced &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ATM&lt;/span&gt; withdrawal (just your last &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ATM&lt;/span&gt; withdrawal,
    no choice if you have multiple &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ATM&lt;/span&gt; accounts, or you and your
    partner/spouse both use the same Mint account), but that just
    complicates things further. There&amp;#8217;s also no logic of tracking cash
    on hand - you can create a &amp;#8220;Asset&amp;#8221; (cash) account, but you have to
    manually update the balance. If you&amp;#8217;re like me and use cash for
    small purchases, or often get meals at local places that only accept
    cash, this becomes quite a bit of a hassle. Even more so if, like
    me, you&amp;#8217;ve ever lost an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ATM&lt;/span&gt; card on a holiday weekend, and now keep
    some actual cash in the house. Honestly, I think this is my biggest
    complaint about Mint, and the one that&amp;#8217;s most likely to keep me
    looking for alternatives. More importantly, this has been requested
    and voted for over and over on their support forums for over a year,
    with no informational response. For a company whose developers
    aggregate and analyze data from thousands of banks, I&amp;#8217;d think that
    letting users type in a series of dollar amounts and then totaling
    it up would be pretty&amp;nbsp;easy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scheduled Transactions&lt;/strong&gt; - On the plus side, Mint parses the &amp;#8220;next
    payment due&amp;#8221; date out of credit card and loan account information,
    so it gives you nice (email, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SMS&lt;/span&gt;, and web) alerts a configurable
    number of days before. However, it doesn&amp;#8217;t even have a feature to
    set calendar reminders for when bills are due, so I&amp;#8217;m still stuck
    opening Mint and Google Calendar if I need to figure out whether I
    can make that big purchase today or if I should wait until my next
    pay check. This was also a very commonly requested feature on their
    forums, and apparently they have an invitation-only beta running.
    But I responded to the thread a few days late, so I wasn&amp;#8217;t given an
    invitation. As far as I can tell, there was never an announcement of
    the beta, and I never got a chance to check a &amp;#8220;please let me beta
    test&amp;#8221;&amp;nbsp;box.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Forecasting&lt;/strong&gt; - This is my #2 biggest issue with Mint, after the
    lack of cash tracking. And the other one most likely to drive me
    either to another service, to write my own software (again), or to
    go back to a spreadsheet. Mint is great at tracking your transaction
    history, your account balances and net worth, and your current
    monthly budget. But it has absolutely no concept of financial
    forecasting or balance predictions. If you&amp;#8217;re on a tight budget,
    this can be a problem. At the moment, I have a spreadsheet were I
    keep a list of all of my regularly recurring expenses (in date order
    over the month), my pay dates, and the combined balance of my
    checking/savings accounts. I can easily see what (within reason, not
    counting discretionary expenses) my cash on hand will be at any time
    in the month. This seems like a no-brainer necessary feature for a
    site like Mint, and combined with its great budgeting features,
    could provide a wonderful picture of what to expect in the next
    month or two, and when I should plan on making that unusually large&amp;nbsp;purchase.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Couples/Families&lt;/strong&gt; - My girlfriend and I both use Mint, and have
    somewhat combined finances (but not accounts). It doesn&amp;#8217;t make sense
    for us to have two Mint accounts, since it would be a real pain to
    keep track of. But, on the other hand, having all of our accounts in
    one Mint isn&amp;#8217;t an ideal solution either. I can categorize
    transactions, but there&amp;#8217;s no easy way to track &lt;em&gt;who&lt;/em&gt; the purchase
    was for, short of duplicating (or triplicating - Me, Her, Both) all
    of the categories. I&amp;#8217;m trying something with tags, but it&amp;#8217;s a real
    kludge in Mint&amp;#8217;s search interface to get a list of transactions
    filtered by category &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; tag. Also, the account name doesn&amp;#8217;t show
    up in the transactions list unless you pull down the Detail box for
    a transaction, so it&amp;#8217;s troublesome to look through a list and sort
    out whose cards everything was&amp;nbsp;on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Miscellaneous:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Passwords.&lt;/strong&gt; In order to sync data from my banks, I have to supply
    mint.com with all of my login credentials. I understand that, until
    banks enter the 21st century (and be smart about it - even a less
    likely possibility) this is just the way it is, and I can&amp;#8217;t blame
    Mint for a system imposed by the banks. But still, I&amp;#8217;m not too happy
    about the idea of Mint storing in plain text (I assume, since they
    need to pass them on to the bank) my username and password for all
    of my banking sites. I got some comfort knowing that the site is
    owned by Intuit - a company that, if not totally security-minded, is
    at least big enough not to fold overnight after a breach. Maybe one
    day, banks and credit card companies will let me specify separate
    credentials specific to third-party software and websites, which I
    could then revoke with my &amp;#8220;master&amp;#8221; password. Until then, I guess
    this is just a risk I have to live&amp;nbsp;with.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Importing Transactions&lt;/strong&gt; - Mint only supports importing up to 3
    months of transaction data per account. Some institutions provide
    less than that. Obviously Intuit doesn&amp;#8217;t want people switching from
    their paid software, so the two &lt;span class="caps"&gt;YEARS&lt;/span&gt; of transactions I meticulously
    categorized in Quicken are now useless to me in Mint. However, I
    guess I can&amp;#8217;t really fault them too much on this one. Firstly, that
    would be a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LOT&lt;/span&gt; of data for them to store. It would also be much more
    of a headache to try and ensure that the export formats of whatever
    software packages they support are properly&amp;nbsp;parsed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mint does a lot of things well. And it&amp;#8217;s a nice clean interface. But
there are also some key features missing, which I feel like I really
need. So, for the time being, I&amp;#8217;m going to keep using mint, but also
explore what other options are available, and look into anyone who
offers an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; for pulling transaction data that might actually be
powerful enough for me to use to write my own web-based app (since my
attempts at pulling &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OFX"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;OFX&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; feeds only
worked for about half my accounts). If you don&amp;#8217;t care as much about
tracking cash spending/cash on hand, and are financially stable enough
that you don&amp;#8217;t need to forecast the next month or two, Mint is&amp;nbsp;wonderful.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="finance"></category><category term="mint"></category><category term="review"></category></entry><entry><title>Links for Wednesday, June 8, 2011</title><link href="https://blog.jasonantman.com/2011/06/links-for-wednesday-june-8-2011/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-06-08T10:55:00-04:00</published><updated>2011-06-08T10:55:00-04:00</updated><author><name>admin</name></author><id>tag:blog.jasonantman.com,2011-06-08:/2011/06/links-for-wednesday-june-8-2011/</id><summary type="html">&lt;ul&gt;

probably noticed that I dropped off the face of the earth. I take my
uptime pretty seriously - even with virtually no budget, about 10
minutes of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UPS&lt;/span&gt; time, and everything hosted out of my basement. I&amp;#8217;ve only
had about a &lt;a href="/2010/03/downtime-past-few-days-coping-with-storms/"&gt;6-hour block of
downtime&lt;/a&gt; in the
past 21 months, aside from that nothing externally visible except a few
sub-3-minute hiccups. And the 6 hours was due to a major power outage
that quickly overwhelmed my &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UPS&lt;/span&gt;. Without a generator, I can&amp;#8217;t really
blame anyone for that. Anyway, last night into this morning I had
partial to full outages for about 12 hours. By far the most I&amp;#8217;ve had
since I literally ripped apart my entire infrastructure, moved it from
shelves to a rack, and put it back together on the&amp;nbsp;fly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;d like to apologize to the few people whose web sites or other
services I host out of my house. On one hand, I think those few people
are getting their money&amp;#8217;s worth from their free hosting :) On the other
hand I know how frustrating it can be, especially when you can&amp;#8217;t even
resolve &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DNS&lt;/span&gt; and my email is down. Rest assured that this situation
deeply bothers me, and I&amp;#8217;m already hard at work on plans to at least
keep people (both the people I do hosting for and their visitors)
informed if something like this should happen in the&amp;nbsp;future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The&amp;nbsp;Story:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, yesterday afternoon as I was at my father&amp;#8217;s house about an hour
away, I started to get a slew of &lt;a href="http://www.nagios.org"&gt;Nagios&lt;/a&gt;
notification SMSes (well, email to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SMS&lt;/span&gt;). They started at 14:22 and
stopped after a few minutes, but since I was driving, I didn&amp;#8217;t check
them. When I got home, I found a scenario I hadn&amp;#8217;t really anticipated -
the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TV&lt;/span&gt; worked fine, but I had virtually no connectivity on my cable
Internet line. I got home around 16:22 and had spotty-at-best
connectivity. I could get some &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DNS&lt;/span&gt; in and out, but it was pretty much
impossible to load a web page on my desktop. I was getting Nagios alerts
out in bursts, and the postfix queue was pretty full. A cursory
inspection showed both routers (mine and Optimum&amp;#8217;s) online with link,
the Modem had link and was blinking away, but I was passing &amp;lt; 100 Kbps
of data. My &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DOCSIS&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;MIB&lt;/span&gt; checks on the cable modem were spitting back all
sorts of bad values. Not good. I checked coax connections, rebooted the
modem and router, and went outside to inspect the aerials and the
splitters on the outside of the house. Nothing visibly wrong, and no
positive change after the reboot. Now the modem wasn&amp;#8217;t showing link at
all, and I couldn&amp;#8217;t even ping its &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LAN&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;IP&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I called Optimum at 17:12 and went through the initial troubleshooting
with the technical support guy. I told him I&amp;#8217;d already power-cycled the
modem, and gave him a rundown of the status lights. He confirmed that
they couldn&amp;#8217;t even see the modem on the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WAN&lt;/span&gt; side, and would have to send
a tech out. The big plus to Optimum Business is that, despite it being
after 5 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PM&lt;/span&gt; on a Sunday night, I was given an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ETA&lt;/span&gt; of 2-4 hours. After
about 15 minutes, I power-cycled the modem again, and was able to get
link. I was seeing some data pushed through the routers, but only about
50Kbps. I called Optimum back, spoke with another tech, and was told
that they couldn&amp;#8217;t even get diagnostics back from the modem, and were
seeing 94% packet loss on ping. Time to wait for the&amp;nbsp;tech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The field tech arrived at 17:53. Utterly amazing&amp;#8230; about 30 minutes
after I got off the phone with tech support. I don&amp;#8217;t know if they keep
their better techs waiting around for business customers, but this guy -
Jason - was one of the most knowledgeable and experienced that I&amp;#8217;ve ever
met. He poked around the modem a bit, re-did some of the shoddy work
that the original installers left, and then climbed the pole to figure
out what was going on. About half an hour later, he came back with the
bad news. His test scope wouldn&amp;#8217;t even lock on to the 609MHz carrier
used for the cable modem, so there was something definitely wrong, and
it was past the pole in front of the house. He told me they&amp;#8217;d need to
escalate the problem to the outside plant engineers, but since I was a
business customer, I could expect some update or fix in 6-18 hours. He
left around 18:30. Well, I was bummed, but I used the time to get other
stuff done and start planning for at least minimal &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DR&lt;/span&gt; plans for the&amp;nbsp;future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to my off-site Nagios, I at least got some mail out and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SSH&lt;/span&gt; in
from 19:55 to 20:44, and then had another total loss of connectivity.
Everything came back around 02:20 today, meaning a full 12 hours of&amp;nbsp;downtime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Analysis and Future&amp;nbsp;Plans:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well for the foreseeable future I&amp;#8217;m just working my day job and probably
not doing much (paid) consulting, so purchasing a backup connection is
out of the question - especially since FiOS charges almost twice what
Optimum does for static &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IP&lt;/span&gt; service. There&amp;#8217;s really no way I could&amp;#8217;ve
prevented this outage, and it turns out that the problem wasn&amp;#8217;t even on
my property, so it&amp;#8217;s not anything I could have fixed myself (or
prevented by convincing Optimum to let me purchase a spare modem to keep
on hand). Once again, for something that isn&amp;#8217;t directly money-making for
me, it&amp;#8217;s not really worth it to try and get hosting as a backup, since
I&amp;#8217;ve got all sorts of complex postfix configurations, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BIND&lt;/span&gt; master/slave
replication, etc. Within my budget, I can&amp;#8217;t really say there&amp;#8217;s anything
I could do to solve this problem, or to get even half of my services
back up. My offsite Nagios is behind a dynamic residential cable
connection, so that won&amp;#8217;t really fix any problems&amp;nbsp;either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My plan for the short-term is to find a static &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IP&lt;/span&gt; somewhere that I can
run a box behind, add it as a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NS&lt;/span&gt; record, and at the minimum setup a
caching Postfix server, a catch-all Apache server with a &amp;#8220;we know about
it, we&amp;#8217;re coming back soon&amp;#8221; page, and hacked &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BIND&lt;/span&gt; zone files that point
everything at this one box (albeit with a low&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TTL&lt;/span&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If anyone out there happens to read this, any comments on how to deal
with a total loss of connectivity on a budget of, say, $15/month above
the cost of my Optimum&amp;nbsp;connection??&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="disaster recovery"></category><category term="downtime"></category><category term="failover"></category><category term="redundancy"></category></entry><entry><title>Links for Wednesday, January 5, 2011</title><link href="https://blog.jasonantman.com/2011/01/links-for-wednesday-january-5-2011/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-01-05T11:55:00-05:00</published><updated>2011-01-05T11:55:00-05:00</updated><author><name>admin</name></author><id>tag:blog.jasonantman.com,2011-01-05:/2011/01/links-for-wednesday-january-5-2011/</id><summary type="html">&lt;ul&gt;

our Linux boxes (including a sudoers file based on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LDAP&lt;/span&gt; group
membership), we usually do work on some boxes as root (&lt;code&gt;sudo su -&lt;/code&gt;).
This includes our &lt;a href="http://www.puppetlabs.com/"&gt;puppetmaster&lt;/a&gt;, where
configs are kept in subversion and edited as root. The one problem with
this is how to get the username of the actual committer, not root, in
subversion&amp;nbsp;messages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The theory that I came up with is a &lt;a href="/2011/01/how-to-get-actual-login-username-when-using-sudo-su/"&gt;shell script that finds out who the
actual user
is&lt;/a&gt;, and
then tacking this onto the beginning of the subversion commit message
(since there&amp;#8217;s no real way to do client-side hooks in subversion). While
I struggled with subversion&amp;#8217;s lack of good client hooks, I came up with
a theory based on a script that preloads svn-commit.tmp and then calls
the text editor. It&amp;#8217;s actually quite&amp;nbsp;simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, in your .bashrc or wherever you setup environment variables,
&lt;code&gt;export SVN_EDITOR=/usr/local/bin/svnPreCommitClientHook.sh&lt;/code&gt;. This way,
every time you run &lt;code&gt;svn commit&lt;/code&gt;, instead of calling your text editor
with &lt;code&gt;svn-commit.tmp&lt;/code&gt; as an argument, the bash script will do what it
needs to (commit message preloading) with svn-commit.tmp and &lt;em&gt;then&lt;/em&gt; call
your editor to finish the&amp;nbsp;message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;/usr/local/bin/svnPreCommitClientHook.sh&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ch"&gt;#!/bin/bash&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;LOGNAME&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sb"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;/usr/local/bin/getLogname.py&lt;span class="sb"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# script to get user&amp;#39;s actual login name, even if using sudo su&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; -e &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;\nBY: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$&lt;span class="caps"&gt;LOGNAME&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;gt; svn-commit.foo
cat svn-commit.tmp &amp;gt;&amp;gt; svn-commit.foo
mv svn-commit.foo svn-commit.tmp
&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$&lt;span class="caps"&gt;EDITOR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; svn-commit.tmp
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Using this method, running &lt;code&gt;svn commit&lt;/code&gt; will pull up your text editor
with &amp;#8220;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;BY&lt;/span&gt;: username&amp;#8221; already inserted in the commit&amp;nbsp;message.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="linux"></category><category term="puppet"></category><category term="subversion"></category><category term="svn"></category></entry><entry><title>Net Neutrality - What is it, and what will the recent FCC decision do?</title><link href="https://blog.jasonantman.com/2010/12/net-neutrality-what-is-it-and-what-will-the-recent-fcc-decision-do/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-12-23T09:07:00-05:00</published><updated>2010-12-23T09:07:00-05:00</updated><author><name>admin</name></author><id>tag:blog.jasonantman.com,2010-12-23:/2010/12/net-neutrality-what-is-it-and-what-will-the-recent-fcc-decision-do/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_neutrality"&gt;Net Neutrality&lt;/a&gt; is a

&lt;strong&gt;big&lt;/strong&gt; issue these days, and one that&amp;#8217;s exploded out of the geek
circles into mainstream media. I&amp;#8217;ll admit that it seems like there are
endless variations on exactly what people consider Net Neutrality to be
(or what it &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be). The general goal of Net Neutrality is to
ensure that Internet Service Providers (ISPs) provide (relatively)
unfiltered access to the Internet to their customers. Specifically, that
if a given customer pays for a level of service - i.e. 10 Mbps
downstream speed and 2.5 Mbps upstream speed - they receive that speed
no matter what they are accessing. The goal of Net Neutrality is to
require ISPs to treat their connections as a &amp;#8220;common carrier&amp;#8221;, much like
telephone companies or freight trucks. Within reason (excepting
explosives and other hazardous materials), &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UPS&lt;/span&gt; will ship a package for a
given rate based only on what it weighs and how far it&amp;#8217;s going (since
the Internet is run by many companies, and data passes from one to
another, the distance portion of this analogy is constant). They don&amp;#8217;t
charge more based on what&amp;#8217;s in the box, and they don&amp;#8217;t ship come boxes
faster than others based simply on who sent it or what&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;inside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Likewise, over the past century, many laws have been created that
regulate the telephone industry. While there was a time when customers
had to rent their telephones from the phone company, long-standing
legislation states that a customer can hook any properly functioning
device into the phone network, and a customer can say whatever they want
over the phone and receive the same call quality, at the same&amp;nbsp;rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To try and summarize, the goal of Net Neutrality is to ensure that you,
the customer of an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISP&lt;/span&gt; (whether cable, FiOS, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DSL&lt;/span&gt;, etc.), is entitled to
certain rights. Generally (the exact interpretation of this concept
varies) this&amp;nbsp;includes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The ability to connect any device you want to your Internet
    connection - any computer, game console, or other device, running
    any operating system or other&amp;nbsp;software.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your ability to connect to any service (web site, protocol, etc.)
    that you want without it being intentionally degraded or slowed
    down, even if it&amp;#8217;s a service viewed to be a competitor of your&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISP&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your ability to transfer data to and from any other user of the
    Internet, regardless of who they&amp;nbsp;are.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What could happen if Net Neutrality isn&amp;#8217;t&amp;nbsp;enforced?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me first say that most of the following is pure speculation. These
are things that &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; happen, but most have not yet actually been
done. Some have. The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISP&lt;/span&gt; industry seems to say that Net Neutrality is &amp;#8220;a
solution without a problem&amp;#8221;, but my personal view is that those are
generally good things. Preventing a problem from occurring is generally
better than fixing it after it&amp;#8217;s a problem. So here are a few scenarios
of what could happen if Net Neutrality isn&amp;#8217;t properly legislated and&amp;nbsp;enforced:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Companies like Cablevision, Comcast, Verizon, and other major ISPs
    also offer &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TV&lt;/span&gt; services (Optimum, FiOS &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TV&lt;/span&gt;, etc.) that include Video
    On Demand (VoD) as a separate paid service. Websites like Hulu and
    Netflix offer the same service, for free or a much cheaper rate.
    Without Net Neutrality, your &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISP&lt;/span&gt; could intentionally slow down or
    block sites like Hulu or Netflix to force you to buy their more
    expensive service. Comcast has &lt;a href="http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9198498/Comcast_demands_fees_for_Web_movie_viewing_Level_3_says"&gt;already
    tried&lt;/a&gt;
    to do something like this, asking Netflix&amp;#8217;s &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISP&lt;/span&gt; for a substantial
    fee to allow Comcast customers to access Netfix (that&amp;#8217;s a bit of an
    oversimplification, but gets the point). If this happens, it&amp;#8217;s most
    likely that Netfix will have to increase their fees substantially.
    Net Neutrality legislation would require ISPs like Comcast to treat
    all Internet traffic the same, whether it&amp;#8217;s from Netflix, Facebook,
    or my humble little&amp;nbsp;blog.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A few ISPs (mainly Comcast) have already tried all-out blocking Peer
    to Peer (p2p) file sharing traffic such as bitTorrent, Kazaa, etc.
    While they cite copyright infringement as the reason, there are many
    people who use p2p file sharing to distribute legal files, such as
    the Linux operating system and other free software. Blocking all p2p
    traffic because some people use it for illegal purposes is based on
    a presumption of guilt, no different from outlawing steak knives
    because some people stab other people with&amp;nbsp;them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Throughout the history of the Internet, some of the most popular and
    innovative technologies, including Google, Facebook, etc. have
    started out as small projects run by a few geeks and programmers. If
    ISPs were allowed to charge content providers (i.e. websites) to be
    viewed by the ISPs customers, it would limit innovation and new
    technologies to only the big businesses with enough money to pay
    these artificial&amp;nbsp;tolls.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most ISPs also offer a phone service. It would be trivial for them
    to flat-out prevent their customers from using Vonage, Skype, iChat,
    etc. and force you to subscribe to their service. It&amp;#8217;s also possible
    for them to do this in a covert way - when Comcast blocked
    bitTorrent users, they did it in a way so clever that it took weeks
    for experts to figure&amp;nbsp;out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Without a mandate that any suitable device can connect to the
    network, your &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISP&lt;/span&gt; could partner with, for example, Dell and
    Microsoft, and say that you could only get Internet access on a Dell
    computer running the latest version of Windows (yes, this is a bit
    of a stretch, but possible in an unregulated &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISP&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;market).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The important fact to note here is that most people in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; don&amp;#8217;t have
much choice in terms of broadband ISPs - generally the only &amp;#8220;choice&amp;#8221; is
between the cable and phone companies, who provide more or less the same
service. With such limited choice, Internet users are effectively held
hostage by the policies of a handful of companies that control Internet&amp;nbsp;access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A short note on the History of the&amp;nbsp;Internet&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contrary to the ISPs &amp;#8220;solution without a problem&amp;#8221; view, I think this is
a solution that should have been implemented long ago. The network that
evolved into what we now know as the Internet, in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt;, was first
developed in the 1970s. The project, ARPAnet, was developed by the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt;
government for research purposes, and funded by taxpayer money. It
wasn&amp;#8217;t opened to commercial use until the early 1990s, when it was
privatized. While the development into what is now the Internet could
never have been foreseen at that time, Net Neutrality rules should have
been built in from the start when the project was handed over from the
federal government to the private sector. Regardless, it must be
remembered that the Internet is a technology that was originally
developed with taxpayer funds, for the country as a&amp;nbsp;whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FCC&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;doing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, in short, not much. It appears that the Net Neutrality rules
delivered by the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FCC&lt;/span&gt; earlier this week are, more than anything, a
compromise effort to make the issue just &amp;#8220;go away&amp;#8221;. The ISPs feel that
the rules aren&amp;#8217;t needed (and argue that the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FCC&lt;/span&gt; doesn&amp;#8217;t have the power
to make them), and most Net Neutrality proponents feel that the rules
pay only lip service to the goals of Net Neutrality. The main failings
already apparent in the rules&amp;nbsp;are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Two of three major parts of the rules ignore wireless ISPs (cellular
    carriers). With the explosion of smartphones, it seems that wireless
    is not only the new frontier of the Internet, but the way that more
    and more people get Internet access. If Net Neutrality is
    legislated, it should be about the Internet - regardless of how a
    customer is connected to the&amp;nbsp;network.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is a provision for ISPs to be able to block or slow down
    traffic as is &amp;#8220;reasonable&amp;#8221; to operate their network, but there are
    no guidelines on what &amp;#8220;reasonable&amp;#8221; means, and it seems that the
    burden of proof would be on the customer to fight their &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISP&lt;/span&gt; in court
    and show that something was&amp;nbsp;unreasonable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Up until very recently, ISPs generally didn&amp;#8217;t engage in the kind of
conduct that Net Neutrality rules would prohibit. The Internet as we
know it today is a product of a world with unwritten Net Neutrality
rules. Amazing sites and services like Facebook, Google, Twitter, and
many others started as experiments by a few dedicated people with little
to no budget. The fact that you can easily view web pages created by
anyone - like my blog - would be ended if website publishers had to pay
ISPs to be allowed through. The choice that you have in using your &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISP&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TV&lt;/span&gt; or phone service, or something like Netflix or Vonage, is central to
the Internet as we know it, but is under attack. I know that many people
look at this as a &amp;#8220;problem for the geeks&amp;#8221;. We take the Internet for
granted. Over the next few days, every time you visit a web site or use
an Internet-based service, ask yourself: Would I be happy if I had to
pay for this? Would this even exist if the people who designed it had to
pay from day one? Make no mistake, if websites have to pay every &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISP&lt;/span&gt; in
the country to be viewed, the days of wonderful free services sustained
by advertising revenue only will be long&amp;nbsp;gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In closing, I highly recommend reading an &lt;a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2010/12/steve-wozniak-to-the-fcc-keep-the-internet-free/68294/"&gt;open letter on Net Neutrality
