I bought another Ubiquiti, of course, but wanted to be a bit more methodical and scientific in figuring out the best placement of it in my&amp;nbsp;house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Years ago when part of my job was supporting an extremely large wireless network, we used some expensive proprietary Windows software (I&amp;#8217;m pretty sure it was &lt;a href="https://www.ekahau.com/products/ekahau-site-survey/overview/"&gt;Ekahau Site Survey&lt;/a&gt;) for performing site surveys to
determine &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AP&lt;/span&gt; location. Essentially you temporarily rig up a running &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AP&lt;/span&gt; where you propose locating one, load a floorplan of the building into the site survey software, and then walk around the area tapping on the floorplan at your current location. At each tap, the software performs some measurements through the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AP&lt;/span&gt; (I don&amp;#8217;t remember what the specific software we used did, but generally it&amp;#8217;s some bandwidth measurement like &lt;a href="https://software.es.net/iperf/"&gt;iperf&lt;/a&gt;) and ends up plotting a (predictive, interpolated) heatmap of signal strength or data transfer speeds over the&amp;nbsp;floorplan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to do something similar for my new &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AP&lt;/span&gt;, but was rather surprised that I couldn&amp;#8217;t find any existing F/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;OSS&lt;/span&gt; solution; only a handful of proprietary options costing anywhere from &amp;#8220;more than I&amp;#8217;d pay for a one-time thing&amp;#8221; to astronomical prices, and none of them clearly with Linux support. The closest I was able to find - and I&amp;#8217;m very thankful that I found it - was a &lt;a href="https://github.com/beaugunderson/wifi-heatmap"&gt;GitHub repository from Beau Gunderson&lt;/a&gt; that plots a heatmap superimposed on a floorplan using a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CSV&lt;/span&gt; file of WiFi signal strength measurements. This was enough to get me started on a similar project to automate the&amp;nbsp;process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over a couple of afternoons I came up with a really rough tool, &lt;a href="https://github.com/jantman/python-wifi-survey-heatmap"&gt;python-wifi-survey-heatmap&lt;/a&gt; to handle this. The full documentation is in the &lt;a href="https://github.com/jantman/python-wifi-survey-heatmap/blob/master/README.rst"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;README&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but the gist is that it&amp;#8217;s a Python &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GUI&lt;/span&gt; (wxPython) and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CLI&lt;/span&gt; application that automates the process. It&amp;#8217;s currently Linux-only because it uses &lt;code&gt;iwlib&lt;/code&gt; (wireless_tools) to pull wireless information and perform scans, but that could be fixed by adding collector classes for other OSes. In short you run an iperf3 server somewhere on your &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LAN&lt;/span&gt;, connect to the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SSID&lt;/span&gt; you want to test, fire up the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GUI&lt;/span&gt; passing it the path to an image to use as the floorplan background and the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IP&lt;/span&gt; or hostname of the iperf3 server, and then walk around clicking the floorplan at your current location. For each click the application will draw a yellow circle and then change it to green when measurement is complete, about a minute&amp;nbsp;later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For each measurement point (location on the floorplan), the application&amp;nbsp;captures:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Current wireless statistics including quality, signal strength, and noise level (like &lt;code&gt;iwconfig&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A current scan (like &lt;code&gt;iwlist scan&lt;/code&gt;) of all visible networks and their signal&amp;nbsp;strength/quality.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Three 10-second iperf3 measurements to the iperf&amp;nbsp;server:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TCP&lt;/span&gt; upload (client/application to&amp;nbsp;server)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TCP&lt;/span&gt; download (server to&amp;nbsp;client)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;UDP&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;upload&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After each measurement is complete all data is saved to a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JSON&lt;/span&gt; file in the current directory, and the gui application can optionally load an existing &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JSON&lt;/span&gt; output file to continue a previous survey. None of this uses any sort of shell/subprocess/exec hackery; we interface with iwconfig and iwlist information via the python &lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/iwlib/"&gt;iwlib&lt;/a&gt; package, a cffi Python wrapper around wireless_tools&amp;#8217; iwlib, and with iperf3 via the &lt;a href="https://pypi.org/project/iperf3/"&gt;iperf3&lt;/a&gt; package, a cdll wrapper around&amp;nbsp;libiperf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you&amp;#8217;ve completed capturing data for your site survey, the &lt;code&gt;wifi-heatmap&lt;/code&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CLI&lt;/span&gt; entrypoint processes the data and generates some heatmaps as well as channel utilization graphs like&amp;nbsp;these:&lt;/p&gt;

It&amp;#8217;s very alpha and rough around the edges, and I doubt I&amp;#8217;ll be actively developing or supporting it once I&amp;#8217;m done installing my new &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AP&lt;/span&gt;, but I very much hope that it might be of use to someone else and maybe someone will even improve it a&amp;nbsp;bit.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="wifi"></category><category term="survey"></category><category term="wireless"></category><category term="heatmap"></category><category term="python"></category></entry><entry><title>Home Automation and Security System Overview</title><link href="https://blog.jasonantman.com/2018/08/home-automation-and-security-system-overview/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-08-18T19:19:00-04:00</published><updated>2018-08-18T19:19:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Jason Antman</name></author><id>tag:blog.jasonantman.com,2018-08-18:/2018/08/home-automation-and-security-system-overview/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;An overview of the current working state of my &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DIY&lt;/span&gt; home automation and security&amp;nbsp;system.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;!--- remove this next line to disable Table of Contents --&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve done a lot of work on my &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DIY&lt;/span&gt; HomeAssistant-based home automation and security system since my &lt;a href="/2018/07/ip-camera-home-security-and-automation-update/"&gt;last post on it&lt;/a&gt; just over a month ago. While it was a lot of work and frustrating at times, I&amp;#8217;m happy to say that I think I&amp;#8217;ve finally gotten everything to a usable and working state, and I don&amp;#8217;t currently have anything left on my to-do list for this project. I have four working security cameras that run both motion detection and object detection and notify me if a person is detected, a functional alarm system for unauthorized entry, and a few home automation&amp;nbsp;conveniences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Virtually all of the code and configuration backing this is available in my &lt;a href="https://github.com/jantman/home-automation-configs"&gt;home-automation-configs GitHub repo&lt;/a&gt; but I want to use this post to go over each of the major components as well as some of the difficulties I&amp;nbsp;encountered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="security-cameras"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#security-cameras"&gt;Security&amp;nbsp;Cameras&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About a month ago I purchased the two more security cameras I&amp;#8217;d been thinking about, a pair of WiFi  &lt;a href="https://amcrest.com/amcrest-prohd-outdoor-1080p-wifi-wireless-ip-security-bullet-camera-ip67-weatherproof-1080p-1920tvl-ip2m-852w-white.html"&gt;Amcrest &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IP2M&lt;/span&gt;-852W&lt;/a&gt; 1080P with a super-wide 128º field of view. After switching out the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IPM&lt;/span&gt;-723W (960P / 92º FoV) on my front porch for one of them and mounting the other on the far side of the house, I now have a total of four cameras (three outside, one inside) and coverage of both entrances to my house and all meaningful approaches to the&amp;nbsp;property.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing I didn&amp;#8217;t take into account, unfortunately, was the signal strength from my aged (in-service 24x7 for ) 2.4GHz Ubiquiti Networks access point at the far corners of the house. After a sweaty, hot summer afternoon up on a ladder mounting a camera at the back corner of the house and attempting in vain to aim it using the stream over WiFi, I realized that the construction of my (rental) house causes severe signal shadows at the back corners. I spent a fruitless few hours trying to set up a Netgear &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WN3000RP&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#8220;WiFi Range Extender&amp;#8221; that I picked up at Best Buy (the setup process was horribly frustrating and error-prone even for someone who worked as a wireless network engineer) only to realize that it was actually a layer 3 router and nothing connected to the extended network could be accessed from my&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;LAN&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After spending another afternoon considering some options - moving my &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AP&lt;/span&gt; or adding another, neither very feasible in a rented house that I don&amp;#8217;t want to run permanent cabling in - I ended up using existing holes and wiring paths to hook up both cameras with wired Ethernet. In retrospect, I should have done either a proper wireless site survey or at least some spot tests with my phone or laptop beforehand. It would&amp;#8217;ve been much faster if I&amp;#8217;d known about the poor signal beforehand, and I also would&amp;#8217;ve purchased PoE cameras instead of using the WiFi models which ended up requiring both Ethernet and power cables. On that note, my one complaint so far about the Amcrest cameras is that they are &lt;em&gt;either&lt;/em&gt; wired Ethernet with PoE &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; WiFi with separate Ethernet and 12V &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DC&lt;/span&gt; power cables. I&amp;#8217;m not quite sure why they were designed this way as opposed to all supporting PoE, but I assume there&amp;#8217;s a manufacturing or cost&amp;nbsp;reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing that I have noticed in the past month of having both wireless and wired cameras is the difference in frame rate. While my one outdoor camera that&amp;#8217;s actually using the 2.4GHz WiFi works acceptably well, ZoneMinder is all too happy to show me that it runs at between five and nine &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FPS&lt;/span&gt;, whereas the indoor WiFi and outdoor wired cameras run at the full configured &lt;span class="caps"&gt;10FPS&lt;/span&gt; rate. If I had to do the camera installation over again, I would&amp;#8217;ve spent much more time assessing the 2.4GHz coverage around my house from my existing &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AP&lt;/span&gt; and likely considered PoE cameras for all of the outdoor&amp;nbsp;locations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="neural-network-object-detection"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#neural-network-object-detection"&gt;Neural Network Object&amp;nbsp;Detection&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my last post, I &lt;a href="/2018/07/ip-camera-home-security-and-automation-update/#neural-network-object-detection"&gt;mentioned&lt;/a&gt; how I started passing still images from motion events through &lt;a href="https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/"&gt;Joseph Redmon&amp;#8217;s Darknet yolo3&lt;/a&gt; neural network object detection library. With some caveats this has worked out extremely well. While I&amp;#8217;ve decided that my cameras are mainly for remote monitoring and possible evidentiary value, and not really for use as an alarm, I&amp;#8217;m still pushing notifications from them to my phone when my alarm is armed; I&amp;#8217;m just not relying on them as a primary means of detecting a&amp;nbsp;problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One down side to my current setup is the &amp;#8220;tiny&amp;#8221; version of the yolov3 model that I&amp;#8217;m forced to use because of my poor choice of graphics card. I got the feeling that the performance of the tiny model was significantly worse than the full version and, sure enough, comparison tests on the same images proved that. It seems reasonably good at detecting people, but has a relatively high number of false positives. To compensate for this, I&amp;#8217;ve built functionality to ignore certain objects in certain locations in to my image processing scripts; I can now easily log but ignore when yolo detects a stump in my front yard as a cow, or my porch railing as a&amp;nbsp;bench.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My current code for handling ZoneMinder events, available &lt;a href="https://github.com/jantman/home-automation-configs/tree/master/zoneminder"&gt;on github&lt;/a&gt; implements what seems to me to be a reasonable workflow for my needs. When events are detected by ZoneMinder a selection of frames - first, last, and a variable number of high-motion (high-score) frames - are passed through yolov3-tiny object detection. Using the tiny model and 1920x1080 frames, this takes about 1/4 second per frame on my &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPU&lt;/span&gt;. Once a list of detections is obtained (category, confidence level, and bounding boxes for each detected object) it parses the Notes field on the ZoneMinder event to determine what zones motion was detected in, then retrieves the coordinates of each zone on the monitor form ZoneMinder and calculates which zones contain each detected object. All of that information is used to evaluate - via a configuration file - which objects should be ignored. All of this information - the ZoneMinder Event details, object detections and their containing zones, etc. - is passed to HomeAssistant as an event, where it&amp;#8217;s picked up by an AppDaemon&amp;nbsp;app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tie-in-with-alarm-system"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#tie-in-with-alarm-system"&gt;Tie-In with Alarm&amp;nbsp;System&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the ZoneMinder events/alarms are sent to HomeAssistant as events they&amp;#8217;re picked up by an AppDaemon app, &lt;a href="https://github.com/jantman/home-automation-configs/blob/master/appdaemon/apps/zmevent_alarm_handler.py"&gt;zmevent_alarm_handler.py&lt;/a&gt;. This handles the logic behind whether or not to send me a notification for a given ZoneMinder alarm. The logic I&amp;#8217;m currently using is as&amp;nbsp;follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If my alarm system is disarmed, no&amp;nbsp;notification.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If no objects were detected by &lt;span class="caps"&gt;YOLO3&lt;/span&gt;, no&amp;nbsp;notification.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the only motion was in the &amp;#8220;Street&amp;#8221; zones, no notification. I have distinct zones for the road in front of my property, and record motion there but don&amp;#8217;t alert on&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Formulate a short string describing the objects detected and what zones they&amp;#8217;re in, for use in&amp;nbsp;notifications.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If an &lt;code&gt;input_boolean&lt;/code&gt; in HomeAssistant called &amp;#8220;silence_cameras&amp;#8221; is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; on, send a Pushover notification to my phone containing the description of the alert and the highest-motion frame containing the detected&amp;nbsp;object(s).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Send an email containing all analyzed/detected frames as well as the full details of the&amp;nbsp;event.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far this is working quite well for me. I get &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; few false positives with the above logic combined with object detection, only get notified if my alarm system is armed, and as far as I can tell get notified 100% of the time a person is on my&amp;nbsp;property.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="alarm-system"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#alarm-system"&gt;Alarm&amp;nbsp;System&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My traditional alarm system hasn&amp;#8217;t changed much since my last post. I have door/window sensors on both entry doors to the house as well as the gate to my fenced yard and the door on the crawlspace under the house. I&amp;#8217;ve added motion detectors in most rooms, but because of problems with the sensors I chose (more on that below) I only have one in use as a trigger for the alarm, a more reliable model than the other four I purchased. With the addition of a physical control panel near the front door (more on that below as well) it&amp;#8217;s working quite well for me. I&amp;#8217;ve had zero false positives so far, and a 100% detection rate based on HomeAssistant&amp;#8217;s logs of the sensors (and my own occasional forgetting to disarm the system before I open a door). There&amp;#8217;s still something to be desired in terms of reliability of notifications as it relies on my cable Internet connection, but I &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; get notified within five minutes by offsite monitoring if my Internet connection goes down. If I really wanted more than that, I&amp;#8217;d look into some sort of cellular backup&amp;nbsp;connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The overall functionality of the system is incredibly basic: when armed (&lt;code&gt;input_select&lt;/code&gt; in HomeAssistant) and one of the sensors is tripped, it pushes a loud high-priority notification to my phone via Pushover. I opted not to use HomeAssistant&amp;#8217;s state machine-based &lt;a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/components/alarm_control_panel.manual/"&gt;manual alarm control panel&lt;/a&gt; component and rather implement my own logic in AppDaemon. I have an &lt;code&gt;input_select&lt;/code&gt; with three options: Disarmed, Home and Away. The alarm does nothing in &amp;#8220;Disarmed&amp;#8221; state. The &amp;#8220;Home&amp;#8221; state uses only external (door/window) sensors for trigger and the &amp;#8220;Away&amp;#8221; state also includes interior motion sensors. This trinary state is also used to control whether ZoneMinder events notify me, as described previously. My logic doesn&amp;#8217;t include any &amp;#8220;triggered&amp;#8221; state or delay; I get one notification for every sensor trigger. It also doesn&amp;#8217;t include any arming delay, but since I built and installed a real physical control panel near the door, it includes a configurable delay (currently 10 seconds) to give me time to disarm before triggering the alarm if it&amp;#8217;s currently in the Away&amp;nbsp;state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One added bit of fancy-ness that I put into the alarm is integration with ZoneMinder and my cameras. All of the doors (as well as the fence gate) have external coverage by outdoor cameras, and the front and back doors also share internal coverage from a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PTZ&lt;/span&gt; camera mounted in view of both of them. When the alarm is armed and a door sensor trips, the AppDaemon app that handles the alarm captures images from whatever cameras have a view of the door that opened (including panning the indoor camera if needed). Those images are included in the Pushover notification that I receive, making it much more informative than just knowing that a particular door&amp;nbsp;opened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="zooz-multi-sensors"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#zooz-multi-sensors"&gt;Zooz&amp;nbsp;Multi-Sensors&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my last post I &lt;a href="/2018/07/ip-camera-home-security-and-automation-update/#doorwindow-and-motion-sensors"&gt;mentioned&lt;/a&gt; that I&amp;#8217;d purchased some Z-Wave security sensors, including a $40 &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01MQXXG0I/"&gt;EcoLink &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PIRZWAVE2&lt;/span&gt;.5-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ECO&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Z-Wave Plus &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PIR&lt;/span&gt; motion sensor &amp;#8220;with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PET&lt;/span&gt; immunity&amp;#8221; (I&amp;#8217;m pretty sure they mean domestic animals, not Positron Emission Tomography). I originally just set it to lowest sensitivity (via a physical jumper) and balanced it on top of the blinds in my living room to see how it worked. I was pleasantly surprised to find that it seemed to work perfectly - it triggered every time I moved in the room, and never when no person was in the room. After a week or so I decided that it was working well enough to order some more for full coverage of my house. I put the EcoLink &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PIR&lt;/span&gt; sensor in the back room that I use for storage and the cats&amp;#8217; food and litter boxes, and in the month-plus since then it&amp;#8217;s had a 100% accuracy&amp;nbsp;rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I began shopping for four more sensors, though, I was tempted to see if I could find something a bit less expensive. As I&amp;#8217;d just gotten my Z-Wave thermostat working, I was really intrigued by the $36 &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01AKSO80O/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ZOOZ&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ZSE40&lt;/span&gt; 4-in-1 sensor, version 2.0&lt;/a&gt; which combines a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PIR&lt;/span&gt; motion sensor with sensors for light, temperature, and humidity. I figured these would let me save a tiny bit of money while also getting the bonus of temperature sensors in every room, and the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PIR&lt;/span&gt; motion sensors have seven levels of sensitivity - settable over Z-Wave - which I figured would be more than enough to get them to ignore my&amp;nbsp;cats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Zooz sensors only had a 3.5 star rating on Amazon and lots of negative reviews, but it seemed that most of the reviews were for the older (non-2.0) version. Unfortunately I didn&amp;#8217;t heed my concerns and bought four of them, and I&amp;#8217;ve regretted that ever since. Setting them up initially was nowhere near as simple as the EcoLink products, since they&amp;#8217;d usually end up going to sleep before they completed pairing with my Z-Wave controller. The same was true of their seven-level sensitivity; each change required me to run around the house with a laptop and paperclip, setting the sensitivity I wanted and then waking the device up with the paperclip. This often required multiple cycles per sensor until the setting change took. Lastly, and most importantly, the machine I have running &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HASS&lt;/span&gt; and my Z-Wave network went offline for about six hours a few weeks ago. All of my other battery-operated sensors came back online within 30 minutes of getting &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HASS&lt;/span&gt; up and running again, but these took up to four hours to come back even after manually waking them&amp;nbsp;up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all of that, even on the lowest of the seven sensitivity levels, my cats still set them off. The motion sensing is adequate for controlling lights, but causes false alarms quite often for security purposes. I&amp;#8217;ve only had them for about a month and a half, but one of the four is now completely dead - it won&amp;#8217;t even blink when I replace the battery. The temperature sensors are adequate, but not terribly accurate and suffer from serious lag problems. The light sensors function but report in &lt;em&gt;percentage&lt;/em&gt; instead of any actual measurement of light and the scale seems poorly calibrated for indoor use unless the sensor is pointed directly at the dominant light source. The sensor in my kitchen (which is pointed almost directly at the ceiling fixture) reads near 80% with the light on, about 60% with the light off during the day, and about 20% with the light off at night. However, the sensor in my bedroom reads about 2% when dark at night and only increases to about 10% with the light on during the&amp;nbsp;day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all, I was tempted by the prospect of being able to get motion, temperature, and light level sensors all in one package and for a really low price. I ended up getting what I paid for - a $10 motion sensor, $10 temperature sensor, and $10 light level sensor. If I had to do it over again (or, when I eventually do) I&amp;#8217;d get more of the EcoLink motion sensors and add some dedicated temperature/light sensors where I need&amp;nbsp;them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="control-panel"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#control-panel"&gt;Control&amp;nbsp;Panel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After using my alarm system for a few weeks, it was clear to me that relying on proximity detection of my phone (updated by &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPS&lt;/span&gt; using the &lt;a href="https://gpslogger.app/"&gt;GPSLogger app&lt;/a&gt;) or the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HASS&lt;/span&gt; web interface to arm and disarm wasn&amp;#8217;t going to work. The presence detection often didn&amp;#8217;t update fast enough if I was driving to or from my house and disarming via the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HASS&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UI&lt;/span&gt; just took way too long - especially since my phone connecting to WiFi when I get home causes problems with this. After giving it some thought, I decided to build a physical alarm control panel. I did some quick proofs-of-concept using the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HASS&lt;/span&gt; WebSocket &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt;, static &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt; and Javascript served by &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HASS&lt;/span&gt; itself, and an AppDaemon app to handle the logic. It&amp;#8217;s not pretty, but it gives me a working interface that handled my main&amp;nbsp;requirements:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Control of the lights in the&amp;nbsp;room&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Arming in either Home or Away modes, with a configurable delay for arming in Away (and ensuring all external door sensors are closed before&amp;nbsp;arming)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One-touch diarming from Home&amp;nbsp;state&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Code-entry disarming from Away state, with a configurable delay between sensor activation and alarm&amp;nbsp;trigger&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After getting the software side of that working locally on my desktop computer, I decided that I&amp;#8217;d use a Raspberry Pi 3B+ that I already had for the control panel. I ordered a simple 320x480 3.5-inch &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TFT&lt;/span&gt; touchscreen &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01FXC5ECS/"&gt;from Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, along with a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07B5YG4LC/"&gt;decent case&lt;/a&gt; for the Pi and screen, for about $46 total. Assembly and getting the software up and running was pretty easy (my notes are &lt;a href="https://github.com/jantman/home-automation-configs/blob/master/doorpanels.md"&gt;on GitHub here&lt;/a&gt;) and I had it up and running in an hour or so. This has really helped make the alarm more usable, since I have the touchscreen near my front door and can just tap a button to arm on my way out the door, and have fifteen seconds to enter a code when I get&amp;nbsp;home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are a few photos of the finished unit currently hanging out on top of the entertainment center in my living room, just a few feet inside the front&amp;nbsp;door:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id="home-automation"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#home-automation"&gt;Home&amp;nbsp;Automation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;#8217;t delved too deep into the home automation side of things yet, and am going to try not to go overboard with it. The Z-Wave thermostat &lt;a href="/2018/07/ip-camera-home-security-and-automation-update/#thermostat"&gt;that I mentioned previously&lt;/a&gt; is working well, but unfortunately the undersized and poorly-installed &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HVAC&lt;/span&gt; system in my poorly-insulated house renders it largely moot; in the summer heat the air conditioning can&amp;#8217;t keep up anyway so there&amp;#8217;s little need for me to change the thermostat. I do have motion-activated lights in my kitchen which has proved quite convenient and satisfying, and I&amp;#8217;ve also set up some automations around my front porch light to automatically turn it on when the front door opens and it&amp;#8217;s dark outside and to turn it on just before I arrive home when I&amp;#8217;m away from the house at night. I&amp;#8217;ve also set up an automation in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HASS&lt;/span&gt; to detect when I first turn on my bedroom light in the morning, and automatically disarm the alarm and turn on the kitchen and living room lights. I&amp;#8217;m going to try and make this the end of my home automation experiment, but I&amp;#8217;m sure I&amp;#8217;ll give in and add a few more pieces over&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="amcrest"></category><category term="camera"></category><category term="security"></category><category term="surveillance"></category><category term="video"></category><category term="linux"></category><category term="IP camera"></category><category term="evaluation"></category><category term="alarm"></category><category term="IR"></category><category term="homeassistant"></category><category term="hass"></category><category term="automation"></category><category term="z-wave"></category><category term="darknet"></category><category term="yolo"></category><category term="machine learning"></category><category term="neural network"></category><category term="object detection"></category></entry><entry><title>Shamelessly Over-Engineered Coax Lightning Protector</title><link href="https://blog.jasonantman.com/2018/07/shamelessly-over-engineered-coax-lightning-protector/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-07-05T16:43:00-04:00</published><updated>2018-07-05T16:43:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Jason Antman</name></author><id>tag:blog.jasonantman.com,2018-07-05:/2018/07/shamelessly-over-engineered-coax-lightning-protector/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;My shamelessly over-engineered coax lightning protector using fiber media&amp;nbsp;converters.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I wrote a few weeks ago about my &lt;a href="/2018/06/new-home-router---partaker-i5"&gt;new router purchase&lt;/a&gt; thanks to a close lightning strike that came in over the coax for my cable &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TV&lt;/span&gt; and Internet (we have aerial lines in my neighborhood) and fried a good portion of my network (my router, switch, and the on-board Ethernet port on my desktop). A few days later I learned that at least four of my neighbors had damage from the same storm, all to devices connected to incoming coax or their home networks, and in some cases much more catastrophic than&amp;nbsp;mine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given what this &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; have cost me both monetarily and in time - if it had decimated my desktop and/or the rest of my wired devices - I decided that I had to find a decent solution. I bought an inexpensive &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UPS&lt;/span&gt; to provide backup power and hopefully-better &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AC&lt;/span&gt; surge protection (it&amp;#8217;s not a double-conversion so I&amp;#8217;m doubtful it would do much for a lightning-induced surge) but still needed to figure out a solution for coax, the actual source of the damaging surge last month. Unfortunately it seems that there aren&amp;#8217;t many options for suppressing high-current surges on coax that work without permanent installation and with broadband Internet. There certainly are some, but many seem to either have little proof for their effectiveness against lightning-induced surges or are single-use devices that fail destructively and &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; stop the&amp;nbsp;surge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After trying for a while to come up with a decent, reliable solution I realized that I may be approaching the problem from the wrong direction. My cable modem is rented from Comcast, and I really don&amp;#8217;t care if it gets damaged from lightning - that&amp;#8217;s Comcast&amp;#8217;s problem. What I care about is my network. And while there may not be accepted and readily-accessible methods of protecting coax, air-gapping an Ethernet network is both feasible and relatively common. Enter, the shamelessly over-engineered coax lightning&amp;nbsp;protector:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/GFX/mediaconverter1_med.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="side view of my desk with the fiber media converters installed" src="/GFX/mediaconverter1_sm.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/GFX/mediaconverter2_med.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="close-up of one end of the fiber circuit" src="/GFX/mediaconverter2_sm.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/GFX/mediaconverter3_med.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="close-up of the other end of the fiber circuit" src="/GFX/mediaconverter3_sm.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For $84 - a small fraction of the damage that could have been done - I bought a pair of &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06XZ6CV6W/"&gt;10Gtek 10/100/1000Base-Tx to 1000Base-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;LX&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; copper to fiber media converters and a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009938B50/"&gt;2M &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SC&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SC&lt;/span&gt; singlemode patch cable&lt;/a&gt;. I hooked one of them to my router via a standard Cat6 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UTP&lt;/span&gt; patch cable and the other to the cable modem with a similar cable. Between them is only non-conductive optical fiber, effectively providing a relatively complete air gap between the cable modem connected to the coax (which is strung pole-to-pole in the air, effectively like a lightning rod) at one end and my network at the other. The cable modem and its media converter are plugged directly into the wall on a separate circuit from my computer&amp;#8230; so for a surge to make it to my network (assuming everything is wired as it appears to be), it would need to jump from the coax to the mains and then travel to the breaker panel on the other side of the house, back through a separate circuit to my desk, and through my&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;UPS&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may be horribly over-engineered, but for less than $100, I have some peace of mind that the damage from last month won&amp;#8217;t be&amp;nbsp;repeated.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="network"></category><category term="lightning"></category><category term="surge"></category><category term="fiber"></category><category term="coax"></category></entry><entry><title>IP Camera, Home Security and Automation Update</title><link href="https://blog.jasonantman.com/2018/07/ip-camera-home-security-and-automation-update/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-07-02T06:10:00-04:00</published><updated>2018-07-02T06:10:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Jason Antman</name></author><id>tag:blog.jasonantman.com,2018-07-02:/2018/07/ip-camera-home-security-and-automation-update/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;An update on my &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IP&lt;/span&gt; camera and home security project, now branching out into home automation and machine learning as&amp;nbsp;well.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;div class="toc"&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month I posted about my &lt;a href="/2018/05/linux-surveillance-camera-software-evaluation/"&gt;Linux Surveillance Camera Software Evaluation&lt;/a&gt; and my plans for turning some Amcrest &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IP&lt;/span&gt; cameras into a home security system. I&amp;#8217;ve made a lot of progress and some big changes since then and decided that I had better post an update before the effort of doing so becomes overwhelming. There are a lot of changes and new information, and some really cool plans for the future (this has become my new obsession, albeit a prohibitively expensive one), so I&amp;#8217;ll break this up into a number of&amp;nbsp;sections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="amcrest-cameras"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#amcrest-cameras"&gt;Amcrest&amp;nbsp;Cameras&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m extremely happy with the two Amcrest cameras I purchased, and am planning to add two more at some point in the near future to cover the rest of the exterior of my house. The one I currently have outside is an Amcrest &lt;a href="https://amcrest.com/amcrest-1-3mp-bullt-wifi-video-security-ip-camera-pt-ipm-723w.html"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;IPM&lt;/span&gt;-723W&lt;/a&gt; WiFi camera with a 1.&lt;span class="caps"&gt;3MP&lt;/span&gt; 1280x960 resolution and a 92º field of view. It&amp;#8217;s a decent camera and the resolution is perfectly adequate but I wouldn&amp;#8217;t mind a bit more, and more importantly, both sides of my house would benefit a lot from a winder field of view. I believe I&amp;#8217;ve settled on two Amcrest &lt;a href="https://amcrest.com/amcrest-prohd-outdoor-1080p-wifi-wireless-ip-security-bullet-camera-ip67-weatherproof-1080p-1920tvl-ip2m-852w-white.html"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;IP2M&lt;/span&gt;-852W&lt;/a&gt;, which are similar outdoor WiFi cameras but with 1920x1080 resolution and a super-wide 128º field of&amp;nbsp;view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I received some questions via email after writing this post about the Amcrest cameras with Linux as well as the security of them. I think I&amp;#8217;m quite happy with both, but both with some caveats. First of all, regarding security, I&amp;#8217;m skeptical of the security of any proprietary software (especially from a small vendor or one not in the software business) and generally expect all IoT devices to have abysmal security. When I originally purchased the devices, I blocked all Internet-bound traffic from them at my router before even plugging them in. For the time being at least, I&amp;#8217;m going to assume that to be enough for my needs. I certainly wouldn&amp;#8217;t expose these directly to the Internet or allow them to access both the Internet and my home network, as is the case for any consumer-oriented&amp;nbsp;devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve also received some questions about the Linux support for Amcrest cameras. My experience so far has been consistent with my &lt;a href="/2018/05/amcrest-ip-camera-first-impressions/"&gt;Amcrest &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IP&lt;/span&gt; Camera First Impressions - Jason Antman&amp;#8217;s Blog&lt;/a&gt;. The cameras certainly work fine under Linux in general; they can be fully controlled and configured via any browser and you can view the low-resolution &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MJPEG&lt;/span&gt; stream in any browser. Viewing the full-resolution &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RTSP&lt;/span&gt; stream requires either the Amcrest Web View Chrome app or a viewer that supports &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RTSP&lt;/span&gt; streams (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;VLC&lt;/span&gt; or any common surveillance camera software). Aside from watching the stream in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VLC&lt;/span&gt; or Amcrest Web View while I was outside aiming the camera, I&amp;#8217;ve been using either the low-res &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MJPEG&lt;/span&gt; stream in a browser or, more recently ZoneMinder and HomeAssistant, to view it. Unless you want a closed-source native desktop app, I can&amp;#8217;t find any meaningful difference between how the cameras work on Linux vs Mac or presumably&amp;nbsp;Windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="ir-illuminator"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#ir-illuminator"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;IR&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;Illuminator&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first step in attempting to reduce false-positive motion detection caused by flying bugs at night was purchasing an external &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IR&lt;/span&gt; illuminator. I opted for a 12V &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DC&lt;/span&gt; model on amazon that uses the same power supply as the camera (I purchased a splitter for them), the
&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01G6EDOO2/"&gt;Univivi 850nm 12 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LED&lt;/span&gt; Wide Angle &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IR&lt;/span&gt; Illuminator&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;#8217;s a large-ish unit that looks much like a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LED&lt;/span&gt; floodlight, except that when on it emits only a barely-visible red glow from the LEDs. This has helped immensely; I have it placed about a foot and a half away from the camera and it has dramatically cut down on (but not eliminated) the number of times that the motion detection is triggered at night by moths and other light-seeking insects. That being said, with some of the advances I&amp;#8217;ve made in other areas (read on) I probably won&amp;#8217;t be replicating this for my other cameras, at least not initially. I &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; also remark that the light output from this unit isn&amp;#8217;t wide enough to cover the camera&amp;#8217;s whole field of view, and it does suffer from some definite hot&amp;nbsp;spots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s a view of the camera and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IR&lt;/span&gt; illuminator during the&amp;nbsp;day:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/GFX/ir_illuminator_day.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="camera and IR illuminator as installed, during the day" src="/GFX/ir_illuminator_day_sm.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here&amp;#8217;s a view of it at night. Note that this was taken in almost total darkness and to the human eye the illuminator only emits a barely-visible red glow; unfortunately this photo does more to illustrate how sensitive my phone camera is to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IR&lt;/span&gt; than what it actually looks&amp;nbsp;like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="surveillance-software-zoneminder"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#surveillance-software-zoneminder"&gt;Surveillance Software -&amp;nbsp;ZoneMinder&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I last posted I&amp;#8217;d done an &lt;a href="/2018/05/linux-surveillance-camera-software-evaluation/"&gt;evaluation&lt;/a&gt; of a number of options for Linux-based video surveillance, discounted ZoneMinder mainly because of its age, resource requirements, and difficulty getting it running in Docker. I ended up settling on the &lt;a href="https://motion-project.github.io/"&gt;Motion Project&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;code&gt;motion&lt;/code&gt;) because of its simplicity and low resource requirements. Unfortunately, that path ended up being a dead&amp;nbsp;end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent quite a bit of time tuning motion and developing a horribly simple proof-of-concept web interface for it (the defunct project lives at &lt;a href="https://github.com/jantman/motion-pipeline"&gt;https://github.com/jantman/motion-pipeline&lt;/a&gt; if anyone is interested) and playing with masks and various values to get reliable motion detection at 1920x1080 10fps on a RaspberryPi 3B+. While I eventually got that working including notifications with images, it failed completely when I installed the camera in its final environment - the exterior of my house. No matter how hard I tried, I couldn&amp;#8217;t get the motion detection to capture legitimate events but ignore the large amounts of shadow motion when wind caught the trees around my house. I hadn&amp;#8217;t considered this relatively obvious issue when I did my initial tests at my former (and relatively tree-free) apartment complex. It&amp;#8217;s also worth noting that when running motion detection at 1920x1080 10fps, the RaspberryPi 3B+ was essentially at its limits; if I wanted to add another camera of equal resolution and frame rate I&amp;#8217;d need a Pi per&amp;nbsp;camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that non-starter I remembered that the motion detection algorithm in &lt;code&gt;motion&lt;/code&gt; only takes luminance into account (effectively a black-and-white image) but ZoneMinder uses full color in its motion detection. So, I decided to take another look at ZoneMinder. After some initial hiccups I decided to just install the &lt;code&gt;zoneminder&lt;/code&gt; package on the RaspberryPi 3B+ running Debian 9. After a bit of setup, I had it running and processing 1920x1080 10fps on the Pi. This taxed the system quite a bit and the web &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UI&lt;/span&gt; was almost unusably sluggish, but it was enough for me to get &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ZM&lt;/span&gt; up and running and to prove that its motion detection algorithm handles clouds and shadows &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; better than &lt;code&gt;motion&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was apparent that if I wanted to make use of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ZM&lt;/span&gt; with multiple cameras and also have it be useful and reliable, I needed significantly better hardware than the RaspberryPi. After some searching on Amazon, I found a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01KWP82CK/"&gt;refurbished &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HP&lt;/span&gt; Elite 8200 small-form-factor desktop&lt;/a&gt; on Amazon for $300. It was quite a bit more money than I&amp;#8217;d wanted to put into this system, but with an Intel Core i7-2600 with four cores (plus hyper-threading) at 3.4GHz, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;16GB&lt;/span&gt; memory and a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;2TB&lt;/span&gt; spinning disk, I figured it would be more than adequate for four or more cameras (in fact the specs are shockingly close to my desktop computer, which was quite beefy when I built it three or four years&amp;nbsp;ago).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That machine arrived two weeks ago and I installed Debian 9 on it along with the official ZoneMinder package, and it&amp;#8217;s performing amazingly well. With one camera at 1920x1080 10fps in monitor mode and another at 1280x960 10fps in motion detection (Modect) mode, the system barely breaks a sweat with half of its memory free and half or three-quarters of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CPU&lt;/span&gt; cores idle. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ZM&lt;/span&gt; is performing exceedingly well, with the web &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UI&lt;/span&gt; fast and streaming working very well. I&amp;#8217;m still having some false positives from shadows when it gets very windy, but I have a plan for addressing that as well. Overall I&amp;#8217;m really glad I switched to ZoneMinder with decent hardware, and plan on further improving and expanding this set-up in the&amp;nbsp;future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="notifications"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#notifications"&gt;Notifications&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing that ZoneMinder completely lacks is the built-in ability to notify immediately on new events/alarms. The closest that it has are &amp;#8220;filters&amp;#8221;, which run at a configurable interval (usually 60 seconds) and can be set to send email or execute an external command for new alarms. Unfortunately there are some issues around how they&amp;#8217;re configured that result in either notification storms or severe delays when multiple short events happen in rapid succession. After using this method for a few days and researching other possibilities, I found the &lt;a href="https://github.com/pliablepixels/zmeventserver"&gt;zmeventserver&lt;/a&gt; project, a daemon written in Perl that polls the ZoneMinder shared memory map for new events at a short interval and pushes them to clients via a websocket server. After some initial experimentation, I unashamedly hacked up the Perl source, ripped out the websocket server, and modified it to execute a shell command with the event &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ID&lt;/span&gt; as an argument (backgrounded with &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt; so as not to tie up the Perl&amp;nbsp;code).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For my event handler script I wrote something in Python that grabs the details of the event directly from ZoneMinder&amp;#8217;s database, along with the first and best (most motion) frames, and sends them to me via email and Pushover. I&amp;#8217;ve added a bit more to the script but it&amp;#8217;s still quite a hack-ish proof-of-concept and too rough to share, but there&amp;#8217;s really nothing terribly complicated about it: it gets called with ZoneMinder&amp;#8217;s EventId, looks up that event and a bunch of related stuff in the database, and then generates an email and Pushover notification. I&amp;#8217;m not sure if I&amp;#8217;m going to keep using this or try to push most of the logic into HomeAssistant (see below); if I do stick with this script, I&amp;#8217;ll make an effort to clean it up and publish the&amp;nbsp;code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="image-processing-ir-switch-detection"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#image-processing-ir-switch-detection"&gt;Image Processing - &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IR&lt;/span&gt; Switch&amp;nbsp;Detection&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I got ZoneMinder relatively well tuned for motion detection in my environment and notifications up and running, my first bit of intelligence in the alerting process was disregarding events when the camera switched from visible light to infra-red mode. This &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IR&lt;/span&gt; switch occurs twice a day - visible to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IR&lt;/span&gt; around dusk and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IR&lt;/span&gt; to visible around dawn - and was a bit of an annoyance to me. When the switch-over happens, virtually all pixels in the image go white for a frame or two and the image switches between color and black and white. My gut reaction was to ignore events with a massive percentage of changed pixels around dawn or dusk, but that seemed too uncertain. With a bit of thought, I realized that detecting a change from color to black-and-white (or vice-versa) should be rather&amp;nbsp;straightforward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the script was already written in Python, I installed &lt;a href="https://pillow.readthedocs.io/"&gt;pillow&lt;/a&gt;, a modern fork of the Python Imaging Library, and came up with the following snippet to tell whether a specific Frame from ZoneMinder is color or black-and-white (note this is a partial snippet with a lot of unrelated code&amp;nbsp;removed):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PIL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Image&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;Frame&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="fm"&gt;__init__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;**&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;kwargs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# lots of internals redacted here...&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nd"&gt;@property&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;filename&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;event&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;frame_fmt&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;FrameId&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nd"&gt;@property&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;os&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;join&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;event&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;filename&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nd"&gt;@property&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;is_color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;img&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;image&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;logger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;debug&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;Finding if image is color or not for &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;%s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;bands&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;img&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;split&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;histos&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;histogram&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;bands&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;histos&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;histos&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]:&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;False&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="nd"&gt;@property&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;image&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;_image&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;not&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;None&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;_image&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;logger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;debug&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;Loading image for &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;%s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt; from: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;%s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;_image&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Image&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;open&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;_image&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This loads the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JPEG&lt;/span&gt; image (frame) from ZoneMinder as a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PIL&lt;/span&gt; &lt;code&gt;Image&lt;/code&gt;, splits the image
into its color-component bands (red, green, and blue), and then checks if the histograms
of the three color bands are identical. If so, the image is&amp;nbsp;black-and-white.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My notification script simply looks at each event, checks if the first frame is color
and the last is black and white or vice-versa, and if so suppresses the notification
and renames the Event in ZoneMinder for later&amp;nbsp;cleanup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There is one issue with this method,&lt;/strong&gt; when ZoneMinder loses signal from a camera it
generates a completely blue frame until signal is regained. I&amp;#8217;ve only had this happen
once, but at some point I plan on modifying the above to ignore the blue &amp;#8220;loss of signal&amp;#8221;&amp;nbsp;frames.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="monitoring"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#monitoring"&gt;Monitoring&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point I decided that I was sufficiently close to having a minimally-usable system that
I should turn my attention to monitoring it, and making sure I&amp;#8217;m alerted if it stops working.
Since I&amp;#8217;ve moved all of my personal services to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWS&lt;/span&gt;, I didn&amp;#8217;t have an existing monitoring
infrastructure for anything running in my home. Not wanting anything too heavy-weight or
complicated, and having an existing Lambda function to handle re-notification of CloudWatch
alarms, I hacked a &amp;#8220;monitoring system&amp;#8221; together using that Lambda function and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; Gateway
in a few&amp;nbsp;hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The functionality is relatively simple: every five minutes a Python script runs on my ZoneMinder
system that does a bunch of checks and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;POSTS&lt;/span&gt; them to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; Gateway as a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JSON&lt;/span&gt; array of results. The
POSTed data for each check includes the timestamp, a check name, a boolean &lt;code&gt;is_ok&lt;/code&gt; field, and
an optional string with additional information. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; Gateway writes this information to DynamoDB,
and triggers a Lambda function if any of the &lt;code&gt;is_ok&lt;/code&gt; fields changed from true to false. The
Lambda is also run every 30 minutes, and notifies me via email or text message if any of the
check &lt;code&gt;is_ok&lt;/code&gt; fields is False &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; if any of the timestamp values are more than 10 minutes old.
For now, this should suffice as a really simple monitoring system. I also have a quick and simple
single-page web view of the current Dynamo&amp;nbsp;contents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The checks that I&amp;#8217;m currently running&amp;nbsp;are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;System load average&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disk free space as reported by&amp;nbsp;ZoneMinder&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ZoneMinder daemon status as reported by&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ZoneMinder Run State (one of my custom values, not&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8220;stopped&amp;#8221;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ZoneMinder &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SHM&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;free&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ZoneMinder status as reported by &lt;code&gt;zmpkg.pl&lt;/code&gt; (&amp;#8220;running&amp;#8221;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ZoneMinder &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UI&lt;/span&gt; - page loads and has a link to my primary&amp;nbsp;camera&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;zmdc process&amp;nbsp;running&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;zmwatch process&amp;nbsp;running&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My custom event server process running (based on zmeventnotification.pl; see&amp;nbsp;above)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For each&amp;nbsp;camera:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Direct image check against the Amcrest&amp;nbsp;camera&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Camera&amp;nbsp;enabled&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Image check via&amp;nbsp;ZoneMinder&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;zmu frame&amp;nbsp;rate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;zmu last frame&amp;nbsp;time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;zmc process&amp;nbsp;running&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;zma process running if Monitor is set to a motion-detecting&amp;nbsp;state&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the &amp;#8220;Image check&amp;#8221; tests, I do the&amp;nbsp;following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Retrieve the binary image from the camera or&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ZM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use the python &lt;code&gt;imghdr.what()&lt;/code&gt; function to ensure it&amp;#8217;s a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JPEG&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;image&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ensure that the size of the image matches what &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ZM&lt;/span&gt; thinks the monitor size&amp;nbsp;is&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PIL&lt;/span&gt; &lt;code&gt;getextrema()&lt;/code&gt; function to ensure that there&amp;#8217;s more than one color in the image (i.e. fail if it&amp;#8217;s an all-blue &amp;#8220;signal lost&amp;#8221; or an all-black&amp;nbsp;image).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ensure that the histogram of the image has more than 20 distinct buckets / pixel&amp;nbsp;values.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; I&amp;#8217;ve usually found Load Average to be an often misunderstood metric, and one that people rely on much too often (generally without knowing enough about it). ZoneMinder exposes it prominently in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UI&lt;/span&gt; as one of the three health metrics, and while I&amp;#8217;m not sure I agree with this, it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a good metric for the specific workload of this particular system of mine. If you&amp;#8217;d like to learn more about Load Average as a performance metric on modern Linux systems, system performance expert and current Senior Performance Architect at Netflix Brendan Gregg has an excellent blog post, &lt;a href="http://www.brendangregg.com/blog/2017-08-08/linux-load-averages.html"&gt;Linux Load Averages: Solving the Mystery&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="neural-network-object-detection"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#neural-network-object-detection"&gt;Neural Network Object&amp;nbsp;Detection&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was researching how other ZoneMinder users are attempting to reduce false positives, I came by a &lt;a href="https://forums.zoneminder.com/viewtopic.php?f=36&amp;amp;t=26222"&gt;post on the ZoneMinder Forums&lt;/a&gt; from someone who is using &lt;a href="https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/"&gt;Joseph Redmon&amp;#8217;s Darknet yolo3&lt;/a&gt; neutral network object detection implementation for detecting and localizing meaningful changes in ZoneMinder&amp;#8217;s captured frames. This idea immediately appealed to me; if I could reliably tell whether a frame contains a person, for my purposes as a security system, that would completely solve the environmental false positive problem. I was also very interested in Darknet yolo3 as it is simple to build and distributes pre-trained models - my initial testing was as simple as cloning a repo, downloading a few files, running &lt;code&gt;make&lt;/code&gt;, and then running the included command-line script on a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JPEG&lt;/span&gt; image. I was pretty amazed at how accurately it recognized the person, car, and dogs in the image I selected. There is also a Python wrapper around yolo3, &lt;a href="https://github.com/madhawav/YOLO3-4-Py"&gt;yolo34py&lt;/a&gt;, which I found quite easy to&amp;nbsp;use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using yolo34py I was able to relatively quickly add object detection to my Python-based ZoneMinder event notification script. Over three or four days of testing, I found yolo3 using the pre-trained model to be &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; accurate across all of the events my camera captured. The one down side was that, running on my Intel i7-2600 at 3.4GHz, it was taking a full &lt;em&gt;ten to fifteen seconds per frame&lt;/em&gt; to run the object detection. That&amp;#8217;s fine for testing, but if I were to rely on this as an alarm system, I&amp;#8217;d want something considerably&amp;nbsp;faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A cursory glance at the Darknet documentation told me what I already knew - though I have no prior experience with the subject - that running neural network image processing with any reasonable speed requires a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPU&lt;/span&gt;. I decided that I could allocate around $100 to speeding up the detection given the Darknet documentation&amp;#8217;s claim of a 10x or better speedup on a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPU&lt;/span&gt;. I found that about the best $100 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPU&lt;/span&gt; I could get on Amazon was a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;1GB&lt;/span&gt; Nvidia Quadro K600, so I purchased &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BLTE8HK/"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PNY&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;card.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I got the card and requisite software installed and recompiled Darknet with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CUDA&lt;/span&gt; support and attempted to run detection on an image, I was rather dismayed to be greeted with an error&amp;nbsp;message:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;0 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CUDA&lt;/span&gt; Error: out of&amp;nbsp;memory&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;darknet: ./src/cuda.c:36: check_error: Assertion &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; failed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, after just googling that error for Darknet, I found quite a few GitHub issues and mailing list threads explaining that Darknet Yolo3&amp;#8217;s default (and most accurate) model requires about 3.&lt;span class="caps"&gt;6GB&lt;/span&gt; of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPU&lt;/span&gt; memory, far too much for my &lt;span class="caps"&gt;1GB&lt;/span&gt; card (at the moment, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;4GB&lt;/span&gt; GPUs start at&amp;nbsp;$&lt;span class="caps"&gt;500USD&lt;/span&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily for the fate of my project, Darknet also has a pre-trained &amp;#8220;tiny&amp;#8221; model designed to work for low-memory GPUs - like the apparently-puny one I just bought. The project states that its accuracy is only about 2-3% lower, though the results I&amp;#8217;ve seen are noticeably inferior especially when two objects are in close proximity or overlap. For the time being, I&amp;#8217;m still getting notified by my Python script for every motion detection event, along with the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;YOLO&lt;/span&gt; object detection results. I&amp;#8217;m saving every event that has questionable results for later comparison against the full (albeit slow, running on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CPU&lt;/span&gt;) model and possibly other object detection&amp;nbsp;tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="homeassistant-and-z-wave"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#homeassistant-and-z-wave"&gt;HomeAssistant and&amp;nbsp;Z-Wave&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just before I began experimenting with Darknet object detection, I decided that the number of false positive motion detection events I was receiving merited investigation into a more classic alarm system approach. I also received a coupon for the &lt;a href="https://simplisafe.com/"&gt;SimpliSafe&lt;/a&gt; home security system in my address change packet from the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USPS&lt;/span&gt;. After a fair amount of investigation I decided that there weren&amp;#8217;t any off-the-shelf wireless home alarm systems that seemed attractive to me (I don&amp;#8217;t really need central monitoring, but I do need to be able to access the system and status programmatically) but this did get me doing some research, and I found there is a wide array of alarm system components using the &lt;a href="http://www.z-wave.com/"&gt;Z-Wave&lt;/a&gt; radio technology that seemed suitable for a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DIY&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my colleagues speaks quite highly of &lt;a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/"&gt;HomeAssistant&lt;/a&gt;, an open source (though Apache licensed) home automation suite written in Python3. Browsing through the project&amp;#8217;s website and documentation, I became reasonably confident that it could handle my needs for an alarm system (it has a fair amount of built-in logic for this use case, and other people actively use it for this) and that it also integrates natively with Z-Wave. Even better, it also has a native integration with ZoneMinder to tie the two systems&amp;nbsp;together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m really, &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; liking HomeAssistant so far, but I&amp;#8217;ll leave the details of that for a future&amp;nbsp;post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="doorwindow-and-motion-sensors"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#doorwindow-and-motion-sensors"&gt;Door/Window and Motion&amp;nbsp;Sensors&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a bit of research, I determined that I wanted Z-Wave Plus components for their better (than none) security and advanced features and purchased some initial Z-Wave components to test from Amazon: a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USB&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00X0AWA6E/"&gt;Aeotec Gen5 Z-Stick&lt;/a&gt; Z-Wave controller for $45, an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01N5HB4U5/"&gt;Ecolink Z-Wave Plus magnetic Door/Window sensor&lt;/a&gt; for $30, and an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01MQXXG0I/"&gt;Ecolink Z-Wave Plus &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PIR&lt;/span&gt; Motion Sensor&lt;/a&gt; for $40. I figured that was a reasonable enough price to test the system and determine how well it works, and either move forward or return the&amp;nbsp;items.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far I&amp;#8217;ve had the Z-Wave components running via HomeAssistant for seven days, with the door sensor on my front door and the motion sensor placed atop the adjacent window. I&amp;#8217;ve configured HomeAssistant to do nothing more than notify me via Pushover when the door opens or motion is sensed. So far in a week, I&amp;#8217;ve received zero false-positive alarms and zero false-negative alarms, so I&amp;#8217;m quite happy. The motion or door opening signals make it from the sensors to HomeAssistant, out to Pushover, and to my phone within one to three seconds, which seems quite reasonable to me. The &amp;#8220;pet immunity&amp;#8221; on the motion sensor &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; still triggered by my two dogs walking around, but that&amp;#8217;s rather expected since they&amp;#8217;re fifty-five and seventy pounds, respectively, and not a problem since they&amp;#8217;re crated whenever I&amp;#8217;m not home. I&amp;#8217;m quite happy with the performance of both of these sensors so&amp;nbsp;far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="thermostat"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#thermostat"&gt;Thermostat&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last weekend, after unpacking and enabling my two &lt;a href="https://github.com/jantman/pi2graphite"&gt;RaspberryPi-to-Graphite temperature sensors&lt;/a&gt;, I finally determined that I&amp;#8217;m not going crazy but the thermostat in my house was. It was wildly inaccurate, and letting the house overheat during the day and then over-cooling at night. I knew I had to replace it and, having seen that HomeAssistant supports climate control systems, immediately remembered my dream of having a computer-controlled thermostat that I briefly &lt;a href="https://github.com/jantman/RPyMostat"&gt;explored&lt;/a&gt; since I first built a &lt;a href="https://github.com/jantman/tuxostat"&gt;crude solution&lt;/a&gt; back &lt;a href="http://blog.jasonantman.com/2008/06/new-project/"&gt;in 2008&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a short search on Amazon, I found the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0095P7B80/"&gt;Iris &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CT&lt;/span&gt;-101 Z-Wave thermostat&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;#8217;s a touchscreen 7-day programmable thermostat with Z-Wave, essentially the same unit as the &lt;a href="http://www.radiothermostat.com/products/"&gt;Radio Thermostat &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CT&lt;/span&gt;-101&lt;/a&gt; but intended to work with the Lowes Iris home automation system. A number of the positive reviews mentioned it working with HomeAssistant or other F/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;OSS&lt;/span&gt; home automation systems, and the $40 price was well below most networked thermostats and about the same as a normal &amp;#8220;dumb&amp;#8221; 7-day thermostat at local&amp;nbsp;stores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far I&amp;#8217;m quite happy with it. I had some initial concerns - even though the device is constantly powered and even a Z-Wave repeater, I had to configure HomeAssistant to explicitly poll it on a regular interval for up-to-date information - but now that I&amp;#8217;ve figured it out, the thermostat seems to be working quite well. I can view the current and target temperatures, the operational/power status of my &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HVAC&lt;/span&gt; system&amp;#8217;s fan and compressor, and set the target temperature and on/off controls. The unit &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; show up as two separate controls - heating and cooling - but that seems to be the standard for Z-Wave climate controls and logically matches up with the physical thermostat&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;heat/off/cool&amp;#8221; controls. I haven&amp;#8217;t done any automation with it yet, but at a minimum this should make it easy for me to control heating and cooling based on different temperature sensors throughout the house at different times of&amp;nbsp;day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="whats-next"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#whats-next"&gt;What&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;Next&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This past weekend I purchased two more outdoor Amcrest WiFi cameras - this time the &lt;a href="https://amcrest.com/amcrest-prohd-outdoor-1080p-wifi-wireless-ip-security-bullet-camera-ip67-weatherproof-1080p-1920tvl-ip2m-852w-white.html"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;IP2M&lt;/span&gt;-852W&lt;/a&gt; 1080P models with an impressive 128º field of view - to complete my camera coverage, as well as a few more of the same &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01N5HB4U5/"&gt;Z-Wave door/window sensors&lt;/a&gt;, a pair of Z-Wave lightbulbs to try, and some well-reviewed &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01AKSO80O/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ZOOZ&lt;/span&gt; Z-Wave 4-in-1 sensors&lt;/a&gt; that combine motion sensors with light level, temperature, and humidity. Over the next week or two I&amp;#8217;ll be installing all of that to finally finish the system, and also spending quite a bit of time customizing HomeAssistant to be the heart of it all. I&amp;#8217;ll share my experiences in follow-up posts, but some of the things I have planned&amp;nbsp;include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experimenting with some other machine-learning-based object detection&amp;nbsp;implementations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Localizing detected objects to a ZoneMinder zone in the image, and using that to determine whether to alarm or&amp;nbsp;not&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Modifying the ZoneMinder HomeAssistant integration to know about run&amp;nbsp;states&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using HomeAssistant&amp;#8217;s alarm control panel component to implement real alarm system logic, with notifications to my&amp;nbsp;phone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Having my Amcrest ProHD pan/tilt camera, which has clear line of sight to both front and back doors, pan to a door and capture a snapshot when the door sensor&amp;nbsp;activates.&lt;/li&gt;

The best I can tell the surge must have come in over the coax to my cable modem, as the only devices effected were in close physical and Ethernet proximity to it (and the electrical service comes in to the opposite corner of the house from the cable, and everything else was fine). I&amp;#8217;d been thinking of replacing my aged &lt;a href="https://www.pcengines.ch/alix2c1.htm"&gt;PCEngines Alix.2c1&lt;/a&gt; router running &lt;a href="https://vyos.io/"&gt;VyOS&lt;/a&gt; for a while, but it was still working (despite running constantly for eight years) and I wasn&amp;#8217;t quite sure what Linux router hardware exists these&amp;nbsp;days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily (and somewhat amazingly) both the cable modem and all of my desktop except for the onboard ethernet were fine. But that left me in need of a new system for my router &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ASAP&lt;/span&gt;. After about an hour of looking around on Amazon, I settled on &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B073F9GHKL/"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.inctel.com.cn/product/detail/338.html"&gt;Partaker I5&lt;/a&gt; system. For &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USD&lt;/span&gt; $230 I got a small (approximately 5x5x1.5 inches) box with a 2.42GHz Celeron J1900 processor, four Intel gigabit NICs, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VGA&lt;/span&gt;, serial, dual &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USB&lt;/span&gt; 2.0, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;4GB&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RAM&lt;/span&gt; and a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;32GB&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SSD&lt;/span&gt; - about four times my old router in every measure. Despite having no reviews on Amazon, I decided to give it a try half because I could get it next day (which wasn&amp;#8217;t possible with the newer PCEngines &lt;span class="caps"&gt;APU&lt;/span&gt; boards, though they&amp;#8217;re half the cost) and half because the description listed it as compatible with RouterOS, Mikrotik, m0n0wall, IPCop, etc. It also appears visually to be very similar to the &lt;a href="https://protectli.com/product/fw1/"&gt;Protectli &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FW1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; which is both listed in the &lt;a href="https://wiki.vyos.net/wiki/Network_appliances"&gt;VyOS wiki&lt;/a&gt; and has &lt;a href="https://protectli.com/kb/how-to-install-vyos-on-the-vault/"&gt;their own page on installing VyOS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="stock photo of Partaker I5 appliance" src="/GFX/partaker_i5.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a few minor hiccups in the installation process, I&amp;#8217;m happy to say that this little network device is working amazingly well. I&amp;#8217;ve only had it running for about 24 hours so I can&amp;#8217;t speak to longevity, but it worked fine out-of-the-box (it shipped with pfSense installed) and seems to be doing the job exceedingly&amp;nbsp;well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The installation was straightforward using VyOS x86_64 on a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USB&lt;/span&gt; flash drive, though I did find out some interesting bits of information about this device - which shipped with zero documentation whatsoever - that may be of use to&amp;nbsp;others:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are two small tactile buttons on the front labeled &amp;#8220;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SW&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;RST&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8221;. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RST&lt;/span&gt; is, as I figured, a reset button. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SW&lt;/span&gt; is actually the power button. Press it once and the system turns on. Press this scarily easy-to-hit button again, and it sends a shutdown signal to the&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;OS&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The board runs &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AMI&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BIOS&lt;/span&gt;, and the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BIOS&lt;/span&gt; prompt is very short. It took me a few cycles of resetting the machine and pressing Delete on my keyboard, as fast as I could over and over, to get into the&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;BIOS&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When I first booted the VyOS install flash drive, it failed to load with a slew of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USB&lt;/span&gt; errors. I was able to fix this in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BIOS&lt;/span&gt; by navigating to Chipset -&amp;gt; South Bridge -&amp;gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USB&lt;/span&gt; Configuration, disabling &lt;span class="caps"&gt;XHCI&lt;/span&gt; and enabling &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USB&lt;/span&gt; 2&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;EHCI&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By default, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BIOS&lt;/span&gt; is set to stay powered down when power is restored, which is definitely not what I want in a network device. Chipset -&amp;gt; South Bridge -&amp;gt; Restore &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AC&lt;/span&gt; Power Loss is the setting to fix&amp;nbsp;this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After some intense worry that my brand-new router was defective, I found that the Ethernet port labeling on the device is the opposite of how Linux sees the interfaces; the leftmost interface labeled &amp;#8220;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;LAN4&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8221; is actually eth0, and the rightmost interface labeled &amp;#8220;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;LAN1&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8221; is&amp;nbsp;eth3.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ll update this post if I have any issues with it, but as far as I can tell this is a very nice, if not terribly cheap, device to use as a network&amp;nbsp;appliance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that my move is done and my network is mostly back in operation, I plan on writing another post sometime soon on the progress I&amp;#8217;ve made with my &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IP&lt;/span&gt; camera&amp;nbsp;system.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="router"></category><category term="firewall"></category><category term="vyos"></category><category term="network"></category><category term="partaker"></category><category term="embedded"></category><category term="appliance"></category></entry><entry><title>Linux Surveillance Camera Software Evaluation</title><link href="https://blog.jasonantman.com/2018/05/linux-surveillance-camera-software-evaluation/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-05-12T07:18:00-04:00</published><updated>2018-05-12T07:18:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Jason Antman</name></author><id>tag:blog.jasonantman.com,2018-05-12:/2018/05/linux-surveillance-camera-software-evaluation/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;My evaluation of some options for streaming and motion-activated recording of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IP&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;cameras.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;div class="toc"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; The next post in this series is up, &lt;a href="/2018/07/ip-camera-home-security-and-automation-update"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;IP&lt;/span&gt; Camera, Home Security and Automation Update&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my last post, &lt;a href="/2018/05/amcrest-ip-camera-first-impressions/"&gt;Amcrest &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IP&lt;/span&gt; Camera First Impressions&lt;/a&gt;, I went over what I&amp;#8217;d found about the pair of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IP&lt;/span&gt; cameras that I bought to keep an eye on my dogs and my new house. My next step was to figure out how I&amp;#8217;d handle motion-activated recording, and that&amp;#8217;s what I&amp;#8217;ll discuss this time. I&amp;#8217;ve spent all of my spare time in the past week - probably twenty to thirty hours - researching and experimenting and the results have actually been quite&amp;nbsp;surprising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="initial-requirements"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#initial-requirements"&gt;Initial&amp;nbsp;Requirements&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The initial requirements that I identified&amp;nbsp;were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open source (preferably &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPL&lt;/span&gt;) and runs on&amp;nbsp;Linux&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Must be able to run with low-end hardware - either a Raspberry Pi or another small and inexpensive system (I don&amp;#8217;t want this to depend on my desktop, and I don&amp;#8217;t want to invest a lot in&amp;nbsp;it)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Support multiple cameras - at least two, ideally four or&amp;nbsp;six&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Works behind a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTTP&lt;/span&gt; reverse proxy, such as nginx with certificate&amp;nbsp;auth&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can stream live via the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UI&lt;/span&gt;, ideally full resolution with low&amp;nbsp;latency&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PTZ&lt;/span&gt; (pan/tilt/zoom) control from the&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;UI&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;List, search and playback videos from the&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;UI&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Decent mobile support, either via built-in web &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UI&lt;/span&gt; or native&amp;nbsp;app&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Motion detection to trigger recording and notifications/scripts; configurable post-motion recording time; prerecord&amp;nbsp;buffer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On-demand manual recording (ideally via both &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UI&lt;/span&gt; and&amp;nbsp;script/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to disable motion activation/recording via script or&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Detect loss of video/tamper and trigger&amp;nbsp;notification&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Detect loss of camera (on network) and trigger&amp;nbsp;notification&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Relatively straightforward monitoring (i.e. I should get a text message if the system goes down or stops working&amp;nbsp;correctly)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bonuses:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Runs in Docker, even if not officially&amp;nbsp;supported&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Written in a language I have some experience in (which essentially means Python, Ruby, or maybe (maaaaybe)&amp;nbsp;NodeJS)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Only uses&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTTP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nice multi-camera&amp;nbsp;view&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="contenders"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#contenders"&gt;Contenders&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right away I knew two of the projects I wanted to look at: &lt;a href="https://zoneminder.com/"&gt;ZoneMinder&lt;/a&gt;, which I&amp;#8217;ve heard many people mention and seems to be the de-facto standard in open-source video surveillance, and &lt;a href="https://motion-project.github.io/"&gt;Motion&lt;/a&gt; which I&amp;#8217;ve used before and only knew as a limited and somewhat archaic daemon. After some investigation and reading of feature lists, I came up with two other, much newer, contenders in &lt;a href="https://shinobi.video/"&gt;Shinobi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.kerberos.io/"&gt;Kerberos.io&lt;/a&gt;. I saw a few other possibilities online, but they didn&amp;#8217;t fit the above&amp;nbsp;criteria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did all of my initial tests in Docker since I was testing each of these on my main computer and didn&amp;#8217;t want to clutter up the system, and I also &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; like using Docker for testing and deployment of software. That may be unfair for some of them, but it&amp;#8217;s both how I intend on deploying the final choice and my preferred deployment strategy lately in general. I can&amp;#8217;t say that I dove deep into all, or even any, of these options but I gave each of them at least four hours (and quite more than that for some of them) of experimentation. I expect to be able to get something at least minimally working within that amount of&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="zoneminder"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#zoneminder"&gt;ZoneMinder&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://zoneminder.com/"&gt;ZoneMinder&lt;/a&gt; seems to be what everyone talks about when the topic of Linux-based open source surveillance software comes up. It&amp;#8217;s an incredibly mature and long-lived project - first released in 2002 - and for a long time seems to have been the only option. It&amp;#8217;s probably most famous for allowing the user to select various &amp;#8220;zones&amp;#8221; (regions of the image) with different motion detection sensitivity levels, including completely ignoring certain areas. When I started actually looking into it, though, my expectations decreased significantly. During my testing the first problem I found was that, while Docker is now a &lt;a href="https://zoneminder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installationguide/packpack.html"&gt;recommended installation method&lt;/a&gt;, all of the &lt;a href="https://github.com/ZoneMinder/zmdockerfiles"&gt;official Dockerfiles&lt;/a&gt; and most of the others that I could find run it in a single super-container with &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; process, including MySQL and all of the web tier (which ends up being 20-something processes). This is extremely un-Docker-like, and horribly inefficient for me since my test system (my desktop) already runs MariaDB for a number of other applications. The official Dockerfiles are also based on a full and bloated &lt;code&gt;centos:7&lt;/code&gt; image (73 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MB&lt;/span&gt; just for the base image). Lastly, and most shocking to me, while Docker is an officially-supported installation method the project doesn&amp;#8217;t actually distribute Docker images. While ZoneMinder has packages for Ubuntu, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RHEL&lt;/span&gt;, Debian and Gentoo, their Docker-based installation instructions build the image locally which almost completely obviates the entire purpose and idea of Docker as a build-once, run-anywhere packaging&amp;nbsp;format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After some investigation, I was able to find &lt;a href="https://github.com/pschmitt/docker-zoneminder"&gt;Philipp Schmitt&amp;#8217;s docker-zoneminder repo&lt;/a&gt; which provides an Alpine 3.4-based ZoneMinder image. Unfortunately it includes MySQL and doesn&amp;#8217;t build anymore (the last commit was two years ago), but I &lt;a href="https://github.com/jantman/docker-zoneminder"&gt;forked the repo&lt;/a&gt; and was able to get it to build and run on the latest Alpine Linux 3.7 with the distro&amp;#8217;s official zoneminder package. That took me a mere three days, which included giving up on Philipp&amp;#8217;s use of lighttpd and switching to Apache httpd 2.4 configured according to ZoneMinder&amp;#8217;s upstream instructions. Let&amp;#8217;s just say that the process was anything but easy. I eventually got ZoneMinder working, but didn&amp;#8217;t even get as far as setting up motion detection. I attempted to tell my &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ONVIF&lt;/span&gt;-compliant Amcrest ProHD camera to pan right using ZoneMinder&amp;#8217;s builtin &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ONVIF&lt;/span&gt; control support, and my entire machine locked up for about an hour (note this is an Arch Linux desktop with a 4-core/8-thread (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;HT&lt;/span&gt;) Intel i7-3770 at 3.4GHz and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;16GB&lt;/span&gt; of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DDR3&lt;/span&gt; memory). Even before that just watching the live streams of my two cameras (1920x1080 and 1280x960) at 15fps, with motion detection and recording and all other features disabled, would result in them regularly dropping to 1-2 fps for a minute or&amp;nbsp;two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the lockup caused by &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ONVIF&lt;/span&gt; support, I went about setting up resource constraints on memory and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CPU&lt;/span&gt; usage for the container. That was the final straw; no matter what I set the constraints to, even values far in excess of the maximum of what the container was actually using, ZoneMinder seemed to behave horribly. I tried setting the memory limits to 12G (75% of my system&amp;#8217;s memory, when the container was only using ~&lt;span class="caps"&gt;512MB&lt;/span&gt;) and the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CPU&lt;/span&gt; limits to a period of 100000 and a limit of 700000 (allowing it to consume 7 of my 8 threads/virtual cores) and it still performed as though ZoneMinder was crippled. Given that my target platform is a Raspberry Pi (3 B+ with 1.4GHz 64-bit quad-core &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ARM&lt;/span&gt; Coretx-A53 and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;1GB&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LPDDR2&lt;/span&gt; memory), I figured it was time to stop my ZoneMinder experiments. I know people and have heard many positive stories about ZoneMinder, and work with a few people who use it and find it to be great, but I think it&amp;#8217;s just capable of doing too much - and has too high resource requirements - for my&amp;nbsp;needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the interest of transparency, here are some of the &lt;a href="https://github.com/jantman/docker-zoneminder/blob/master/README.md#current-status"&gt;notes&lt;/a&gt; I wrote down during my attempt at an Alpine-based Docker&amp;nbsp;container:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As a preface, I need to mention that ZoneMinder was first released in 2002. It is a mature, even aged, piece of software. The level of effort that has gone into it is astonishing, and the mere fact that it&amp;#8217;s still an active and well-respected project after 16 years is pretty damn amazing, even more so for an open source project. That being said, two of my main criteria for selecting home security/surveillance software are how stable I think it will be (will it run for weeks/months without me even looking at it, and be working when I need it to) and how easily I can customize it&amp;nbsp;(code).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ZoneMinder is a &lt;em&gt;giant&lt;/em&gt; codebase made up of Perl, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt;, C++, JavaScript, and probably some others. There are just &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; many moving pieces (see the &lt;a href="http://zoneminder.readthedocs.io/en/stable/userguide/components.html"&gt;Components documentation&lt;/a&gt;) that I can&amp;#8217;t really imagine this running reliably without intervention for terribly&amp;nbsp;long.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As a corollary, when I did finally get this running, the logs (written to the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DB&lt;/span&gt; and shown in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UI&lt;/span&gt;) kept reporting Errors (in red nonetheless) for processes that died and were then respawned by the watchdog without any noticeable effects in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UI&lt;/span&gt;/streams. I don&amp;#8217;t want to take on a system that doesn&amp;#8217;t even know the difference between an error and a warning, or that reports errors (with whistles and bells and sirens) to the user that it can self-recover from. I intend on leaving this alone as a security system, and need to be able to reliably tell (and programmatically alert on) whether it&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;working&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;not working&amp;#8221;. A process dying and being successfully restarted a second later isn&amp;#8217;t what I&amp;#8217;d call an&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8220;error&amp;#8221;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apparently Docker is now &lt;a href="https://github.com/ZoneMinder/ZoneMinder/wiki/Docker"&gt;a recommended install mathod&lt;/a&gt;, but the &lt;a href="https://github.com/ZoneMinder/zmdockerfiles"&gt;official Dockerfiles&lt;/a&gt; (and almost all of the others I&amp;#8217;ve found) are decidedly un-Docker-like, running &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; including both the web and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DB&lt;/span&gt; tiers in one container. Given how many components make up ZoneMinder, it seems like it would much more naturally be made up of a handful of containers - maybe half a dozen plus a container per&amp;nbsp;camera.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even on my main desktop computer - a relatively beefy machine for its day, with a four-core/eight-thread Intel i7-3770 @ 3.4GHz and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;16GB&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DDR3&lt;/span&gt; - ZoneMinder seemed to be struggling with two &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IP&lt;/span&gt; cameras and I saw occasional framerate drops down to one to two fps. It just seems to be trying to do too&amp;nbsp;much.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I still think there&amp;#8217;s a ghost in the machine re: docker resource constraints. Once I set &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CPU&lt;/span&gt; or memory limits on the container, even if I set them way (i.e. ten times) above what Docker reports ZoneMinder to be using, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ZM&lt;/span&gt; behaves differently and starts to have crippling performance&amp;nbsp;issues.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bottom line: I do a lot of work with Docker, and automating deployment and monitoring of software has been a big part of my job for the last decade. I need something that&amp;#8217;s simpler, feels more reliable, and is easier to deploy and monitor. Something that logs to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;STDOUT&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;STDERR&lt;/span&gt;, looks at least something like a 12-factor app, and feels like it can actually run (if not be designed) natively in&amp;nbsp;Docker.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So after three or four incredibly frustrating afternoons and evenings, I put ZoneMinder aside and continued down my evaluation&amp;nbsp;list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Postscript:&lt;/strong&gt; One of my colleagues, &lt;a href="https://github.com/jbruce12000"&gt;Jason Bruce&lt;/a&gt;, told me that he uses the &lt;a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/aptalca/zoneminder-1.29/"&gt;aptalca/zoneminder-1.29&lt;/a&gt; Docker image to great success. If you&amp;#8217;re considering ZoneMinder, it&amp;#8217;s probably worth trying that image, and it&amp;#8217;s only&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;310MB&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="kerberosio"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#kerberosio"&gt;Kerberos.io&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next candidate on my list was &lt;a href="https://www.kerberos.io/"&gt;Kerberos.io&lt;/a&gt;, one of the newcomers that I&amp;#8217;d never heard of before. It&amp;#8217;s billed as a &amp;#8220;free [and open-source] video surveillance solution, which works with any camera and on every Linux based machine. You can deploy a fully configured video surveillance system within a few minutes on the environment you prefer: Raspberry Pi, Orange Pi, Docker, etc.&amp;#8221; So that caught my attention as it seemed to check a lot of the non-functional boxes - Docker, modern, etc. - right in the introductory &amp;#8220;advertising&amp;#8221;. The website also looks clean and modern, and the screenshots and demo look nice. The one negative instantly apparent is that it only supports one camera unless you use the paid and hosted Kerberos.cloud product, but I figured that I could either run the cloud software myself or else hack something together (their &lt;a href="https://doc.kerberos.io/2.0/installation/Multi-camera/Docker"&gt;docs on Multi-Camera Docker&lt;/a&gt; are essentially just how to run multiple instances, one per&amp;nbsp;camera).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the positive side, Kerberos.io &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; incredibly easy to get running. The &lt;a href="https://doc.kerberos.io/2.0/installation/Docker"&gt;docs&lt;/a&gt; just point to their &lt;a href="https://hub.docker.com/u/kerberos/"&gt;public images on the Docker Hub&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href="https://github.com/kerberos-io/docker"&gt;github repo&lt;/a&gt; with a &lt;code&gt;docker-compose.yml&lt;/code&gt; that runs the appropriate containers (one for the &amp;#8220;machinery&amp;#8221; capture backend and one for the &amp;#8220;web&amp;#8221; frontend), and even has an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ARM&lt;/span&gt;-specific Dockerfile for Raspberry Pi users. Setup was a complete breeze as the web &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UI&lt;/span&gt; starts out with an installation wizard that walks you through configuring the app. After setting up a user I was able to log in and click the &amp;#8220;Configuration&amp;#8221; button on the top menu bar and configure my camera. It was quite straightforward - just select &amp;#8220;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;IP&lt;/span&gt; Camera&amp;#8221; and specify the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RSTP&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt;, dimensions, delay (zero) and live stream framerate, click save, and view the camera. I had a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UI&lt;/span&gt; showing the stream from my 1080P camera and the ability to record within about two minutes. The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UI&lt;/span&gt; initially loads to a dashboard with the live camera view and some graphs of motion detection metrics by hour of day, day of week, and today vs average, as well as a listing of dates (presumably motion detection history/recordings) on the left sidebar. There&amp;#8217;s also a handy &amp;#8220;System&amp;#8221; video that shows uptime, some system information, the currently-running Kerberos.io versions, statistics on captured images, and some system performance information (disk space that was incorrect in Docker, network &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IO&lt;/span&gt;, and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CPU&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;usage).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the system almost instantly showed a &amp;#8220;Hey, your disk is almost full. Please remove some images..&amp;#8221; header at the top of the pages. Yes, with the containers running, my &lt;code&gt;/var&lt;/code&gt; partition was 97% full (lots of churn lately, and lots of cruft from the ZoneMinder&amp;nbsp;tests).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point I went back to &amp;#8220;Configuration&amp;#8221; and clicked the &amp;#8220;Motion&amp;#8221; button to set up motion detection. I was presented with a gray box that I assume was supposed to show the live image from the camera, and some points on a polygon to select a motion detection region. I did the best I could with the missing image and moved on to some sliders for &amp;#8220;sensitivity&amp;#8221; (default fifteen on a scale of zero to thirty) and &amp;#8220;number of detections before valid&amp;#8221; (default two on a scale of zero to ten) and then configured the recording settings: both images and video, no timestamp overlays, fifteen frames per second (the same as the cameras), record five seconds after motion detection, and nothing set for the options to trigger webhooks, scripts, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPIO&lt;/span&gt; or &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MQTT&lt;/span&gt; on detection. I should note that the &amp;#8220;seconds to record&amp;#8221; field is a slider for &amp;#8220;The number of seconds that will be recorded after motion was detected&amp;#8221;, which defaults to five and can go from zero to&amp;nbsp;thirty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I confirmed those settings and browsed back to the Dashboard, where I could see the live video view and&amp;#8230; a whole lot of nothing&amp;nbsp;else:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/GFX/kerberos1.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="screenshot of Kerberos.io dashboard with live webcam feed but all graphs saying &amp;quot;No data available&amp;quot;" src="/GFX/kerberos1_sm.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Refreshing the page didn&amp;#8217;t seem to help get any of the other data to show up, even when there was obviously motion. There&amp;#8217;s a Heatmap feature in the Configuration page, but I haven&amp;#8217;t been able to get it to display anything other than &amp;#8220;No data available&amp;#8221;. Thinking that something was wrong, I went back through the motion detection configuration and found that the region I&amp;#8217;d selected was reset back to the strange-shaped default. I fixed it, pressed the &amp;#8220;Confirm and Select&amp;#8221; button without going through to the second and third screens of the Motion configuration dialog, and then opened the Motion configuration dialog again. This time, the region was effectively empty (a flat line in the top left corner, with multiple points on it) but I could actually see the camera stream albeit frozen at the latest frame. I adjusted the region polygon again, Saved, and then reloaded the Motion configuration dialog&amp;#8230; and got back to a correct-looking region but no picture. I assumed that was right and proceeded back through the three screens of the dialog and found the rest of my settings back to default. Through trial and error, I found that the configuration dialog for the Motion detection has three screens, which are paged through by using either left/right arrows on the sides of the dialog or one of three small circles (inactive two grayed out) at the bottom of the settings. Apparently, while the &amp;#8220;Confirm and Select&amp;#8221; button dismisses the dialog, it only saves the settings on the &lt;em&gt;current&lt;/em&gt; one of three pages. So eventually, I realized that I had to edit the first page, save, bring the dialog back up, move to the second page, save, then bring the dialog back up, move to the third page, and save. I then needed to press the &amp;#8220;Update&amp;#8221; button on the main Configuration page to commit my&amp;nbsp;changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all that, things seemed to be working. Navingating back to the Dashboard showed some actual data on the graphs including a large number of detections for the current&amp;nbsp;hour:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/GFX/kerberos2.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="screenshot of Kerberos.io dashboard with data in graphs and hourly graph showing 18 motion detections this hour" src="/GFX/kerberos2_sm.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, when I clicked on the date in the left sidebar, something seemed to be very&amp;nbsp;amiss:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/GFX/kerberos3.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="screenshot of Kerberos.io dashboard for current date, saying &amp;quot;Oeps, no detections found at 11 o'clock&amp;quot;" src="/GFX/kerberos3_sm.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main Dashboard had reported 18 detections, and the slider bar on the view for today&amp;#8217;s date (above) clearly showed some heatmap colors for the current hour, but it was also telling me that it couldn&amp;#8217;t find any detections (videos/images). On a hunch I looked at the Docker logs for the container, and found the &amp;#8220;machinery&amp;#8221; (capture and storage) container&amp;#8217;s logs full of this, repeated over and&amp;nbsp;over:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;machinery_1  | Cleaning disk
machinery_1  | Cleaning disk
machinery_1  | rm: missing operand
machinery_1  | Try &amp;#39;rm --help&amp;#39; for more information.
machinery_1  | Cleaning disk
machinery_1  | rm: missing operand
machinery_1  | Try &amp;#39;rm --help&amp;#39; for more information.
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As best I can tell, it was detecting that the disk backing the Docker volume was 97% full (it&amp;#8217;s a 100G volume) and cleaning up the disk&amp;#8230; which apparently meant deleting all of the recordings, including the ones that had just been made and I hadn&amp;#8217;t reviewed&amp;nbsp;yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was the end of my experimentation with Kerberos.io. Not only was it apparently executing a shell command (&lt;code&gt;rm&lt;/code&gt;) with invalid/missing arguments, but it was also deleting all of the recordings it had because the disk was 97% full. First and foremost, the camera I&amp;#8217;m using is streaming 1920x1080 H.264 at 15 frames per second; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;3GB&lt;/span&gt; of disk space remaining shouldn&amp;#8217;t be a reason to delete all of the five-second video clips unless the cleanup logic is purely based on percentages. I didn&amp;#8217;t dig into the source code, but I&amp;#8217;m pretty sure if my 100-Petabyte disk was 97% full, it would still start deleting single-digit-megabyte images to free up space. Secondly, and more importantly, I intend on using this as part of a security system which to me means engineering for the worst-case scenario. Under normal circumstances, I should be able to respond to a low disk warning and manually free up some space. My Internet connection is generally very stable, so the &amp;#8220;worst case&amp;#8221; I want to engineer for is someone burglarizing my house and being smart enough to cut the cable line. If that happens, causing storage to fill up, the most important video is actually the &lt;em&gt;oldest&lt;/em&gt;! It&amp;#8217;s the video that was recorded closest to when I lost access to the system. In which case, I&amp;#8217;d want the failure mode to be either filling up the storage or ceasing to record, but definitely not to arbitrarily delete old-but-unreviewed&amp;nbsp;recordings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="shinobi"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#shinobi"&gt;Shinobi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from my old standby of Motion, the last candidate on my list was &lt;a href="https://shinobi.video/"&gt;Shinobi&lt;/a&gt;. Shinobi&amp;#8217;s tag line is &amp;#8220;The open source &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CCTV&lt;/span&gt; solution&amp;#8221; and prides itself on being modern and using modern technologies. The first section of their pretty and modern homepage, https://shinobi.video/, includes a link to the docs and GitHub and&amp;nbsp;states:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shinobi is Open Source, written in Node.js, and real easy to use. It is the future of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CCTV&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NVR&lt;/span&gt; for developers and end-users alike. It is catered to by professionals and most importantly by the one who created&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After seeing what&amp;#8217;s happening under the hood of ZoneMinder, this certainly got my attention, as did the general modern open-source community feel of the site. Granted, I initially missed the section comparing Shinobi &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CE&lt;/span&gt; (Community Edition; GPLv3) and Shinobi Pro (Professional but free for non-commercial use; Creative Commons) and that Community Edition is &amp;#8220;updated only for major changes or bug fixes.&amp;#8221; But the &lt;a href="https://github.com/ShinobiCCTV/Shinobi/blob/2bc74064da5484545d86fce9cf95db74ace0db48/README.md#key-aspects"&gt;current features list&lt;/a&gt; includes most of what I wanted (even audio recording too, from my&amp;nbsp;ProHD)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First I headed over to the &lt;a href="https://github.com/moeiscool/docker-shinobi"&gt;Dockerfiles from Shinobi&amp;#8217;s author&lt;/a&gt;. I had some issues with the Alpine-based vatiant and decided to give the Debian ones a try. One &lt;code&gt;docker-compose up&lt;/code&gt; and some patience later, I had two containers running: camera and cron. I immediately hit the web port and got a login box, which confused me with invalid logins for a while until I went back and re-read the &lt;a href="https://shinobi.video/docs/start"&gt;installation docs&lt;/a&gt; and realized that Shinobi supports multiple users, and I had to login via &lt;code&gt;/super&lt;/code&gt; (superuser) to set up a user account for myself. I did that and logged in as a regular user, and was greeted with a clean, modern, responsive&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;UI&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not being one to read documentation for end-user software, I muddled around in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UI&lt;/span&gt; a bit until I managed to add my two cameras. It wasn&amp;#8217;t terribly difficult: click the &amp;#8220;+&amp;#8221; icon in the top left of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UI&lt;/span&gt; (tooltip says, &amp;#8220;Add Monitor&amp;#8221;) and fill out the form. One early problem I had adding the first camera is that the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt; parsing discards query strings. I added my Amcrest ProHD with its primary stream &lt;span class="caps"&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt;, which has a path of &lt;code&gt;/cam/realmonitor?channel=1&amp;amp;subtype=0&lt;/code&gt;. The stream didn&amp;#8217;t work and when I went back into the settings to edit it, the query string had been discarded. I just changed the &amp;#8220;Automatic&amp;#8221; (parsing of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt;) to &amp;#8220;No&amp;#8221; and manually entered the protocol, host, port, authentication and path details myself, and it worked fine. Shinobi has a very nice interface for adding cameras, and one of the things I liked the most was the ability to choose the streaming details for the live stream; it supports Poseidon, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JPEG&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MJPEG&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FLV&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HLS&lt;/span&gt; (with audio) or a custom base64-over-websockets. The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HLS&lt;/span&gt; stream also allows selection of video and audio codecs including copying the source codec (which is what I did). There&amp;#8217;s also an option for a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CGI&lt;/span&gt;-style &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JPEG&lt;/span&gt; snapshot&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/GFX/shinobi1.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="screenshot of Shinobi dialog to add a monitor" src="/GFX/shinobi1_sm.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UI&lt;/span&gt; is smooth and modern, with a fully responsive design that apparently works on mobile too (though I didn&amp;#8217;t test it). It even includes nice dropdown menus and mouseover menus for streams that  include snapshot, start/stop recording, pop-out, recording list, calendar of events, monitor/stream settings, and fullscreen. It also includes something called the &amp;#8220;Power Viewer&amp;#8221; that I&amp;#8217;ll discuss&amp;nbsp;later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/GFX/shinobi2.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="screenshot of Shinobi with mouseover controls for streams" src="/GFX/shinobi2_sm.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within a few minutes, I had both cameras up and running with their full resolution H.264 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RTSP&lt;/span&gt; streams (1920x1080 and 1280x960, respectively) at 15fps. The camera streams are shown by clicking on the camera in the left sidebar, and the stream windows can be resized by dragging the lower right corner (though it doesn&amp;#8217;t keep the aspect ratio) and rearranged via&amp;nbsp;drag-and-drop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/GFX/shinobi3.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="screenshot of Shinobi with both streams" src="/GFX/shinobi3_sm.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was happy to see that, in this configuration with video streaming but not being analyzed, the Docker containers were only using a combined total of about 5% of my &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CPU&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;100MB&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RAM&lt;/span&gt;. I tried some experiments with snapshots (they force-download) and manually-requested recordings and was quite happy with both. I did have some occasional issues with live streams freezing if I refreshed the page, but they resumed fine if I logged back in. The calendar interface seemed handy - it shows a monthly calendar with the time, camera name, and size of each recording for each day - and the videos list for each camera lists the start and end time, filename, and size of each video for each camera, along with buttons to preview (on the same dialog), watch (fullscreen-ish in the viewer), download, and&amp;nbsp;delete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This all seemed wonderful, so I figured it was time to enable motion detection. Well&amp;#8230; little did I know that would be a six-hour struggle. The &lt;a href="https://shinobi.video/docs/motion"&gt;documentation on Motion detection&lt;/a&gt; is separate, and states that motion detection isn&amp;#8217;t built-in because not everybody wants it and it has dependencies, which is also started at other places on their site. The &lt;a href="https://shinobi.video/docs/motion#content-use-builtin"&gt;first section on the Motion detection docs page&lt;/a&gt; says that it&amp;#8217;s now built-in and people should just use that, but is rather easy to miss (the section heading is at the same level as &amp;#8220;Install on Ubuntu/Debian&amp;#8221;, &amp;#8220;Install on CentOS/Fedora&amp;#8221;, etc.) and doesn&amp;#8217;t explicitly say whether there are external dependencies or not. Without going into the details, I went through a six-hour marathon of trying different Docker images, installing dependencies, running NodeJS scripts, starting other processes, adding containers, etc. in an attempt to get motion detection&amp;nbsp;working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through the course of this I found that Shinobi&amp;#8217;s documentation is quite lacking, and also that it seems to be sporadically updated. The &lt;a href="https://shinobi.video/docs/settings"&gt;settings documentation&lt;/a&gt; contains a lot that doesn&amp;#8217;t seem to line up with what I&amp;#8217;m seeing in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UI&lt;/span&gt;, and I&amp;#8217;m not sure if it&amp;#8217;s because the docs are out of date or because they&amp;#8217;re ahead of the code, or a Pro vs Community Edition issue, or what. There are other places in the docs that seem horribly outdated, and many sections that seem to give conflicting&amp;nbsp;information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At one point I also stopped and tried to configure pan/tilt control, but couldn&amp;#8217;t find a setting for that either, so I went back to motion&amp;nbsp;detection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of my frustration was based on the Motion Detection documentation page and its statements that once Motion Detection is set up you should see &amp;#8220;Detector: Motion Connected&amp;#8221; in the Monitor Settings, and have configuration options for motion detection. No matter what I tried - Debian or Alpine, different images, adding packages and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OS&lt;/span&gt;-level dependencies, restarting the services, trying the older, no-longer-recommended plugin-based method - I couldn&amp;#8217;t find or see the Motion Detection settings like the docs said I should. I just kept trying different things to get those settings to show up. When I was just about to give up and was searching through Shinobi&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href="https://forum.shinobi.video/"&gt;forums&lt;/a&gt; for some confirmation of whether anyone could get this working, I stumbled upon a &lt;a href="https://forum.shinobi.video/post/160"&gt;forum post&lt;/a&gt; that mentioned something about &amp;#8220;Advanced&amp;nbsp;settings&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started the containers back up and sure enough, in the far lower right corner of the Monitor Settings dialog, colored almost the same as the background, was a button that says &amp;#8220;Simple&amp;#8221; and has an arrow. I clicked it, selected &amp;#8220;Advanced&amp;#8221;, and suddenly the left sidebar of the dialog grew&amp;#8230; to include Global Detector Settings and Control, among other&amp;nbsp;options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/GFX/shinobi4.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="screenshot of Shinobi Monitor Settings in Advanced mode" src="/GFX/shinobi4_sm.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as I can tell, motion detection was probably working the whole time and my six-ish hours of struggling were all for naught. The only problem I had was not changing the Monitor Settings dialog from Simple mode - which hides all motion detection and control settings - to Advanced. I&amp;#8217;ve gone back over the documentation multiple times, and there&amp;#8217;s not a single occurrence of the word &amp;#8220;Advanced&amp;#8221; on the Motion Detection page or the Settings page, and certainly nothing telling users that they need to explicitly switch to Advanced Mode to see these&amp;nbsp;settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At that point, I was already quite frustrated with Shinobi and felt that if this was at all indicative of the quality of documentation and user experience, I should definitely avoid it. But I at least wanted to know what its motion detection could&amp;nbsp;do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://shinobi.video/docs/settings#content-detector"&gt;settings documentation for Motion Detection&lt;/a&gt; was mostly straightforward, with the exception of a few&amp;nbsp;settings:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recording Timeout&lt;/strong&gt; - &amp;#8220;The length of time &amp;#8220;Trigger Record&amp;#8221; will run for. This is read in minutes.&amp;#8221; Apparently when Shinobi detects motion it records &lt;em&gt;minutes&lt;/em&gt; of video, with a minimum of one and a default of ten. This was very strange to me, especially since many motion events that I&amp;#8217;ve seen only span a few&amp;nbsp;seconds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Timeout Reset on Next Motion&lt;/strong&gt; - &amp;#8220;If there is an overlap in trigger record should it reset. &lt;strong&gt;No:&lt;/strong&gt; Finish the current 10 minute order.. &lt;strong&gt;Yes:&lt;/strong&gt; Reset the timer&amp;#8221;. I didn&amp;#8217;t have to worry about this since it wasn&amp;#8217;t visible in my&amp;nbsp;version.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Save Events to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SQL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; - &amp;#8220;Save Motion Events in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SQL&lt;/span&gt;. This will allow display of motion over video during the time motion events occured [sic] in the Power&amp;nbsp;Viewer.&amp;#8221;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Indifference&lt;/strong&gt; - &amp;#8220;How much Shinobi doesn&amp;#8217;t care about motion before doing something. The opposite of sensitivity; a lower number means it will trigger sooner. The value ranges up to 15(+) decimal places. 10 is default, 0.005 is pretty sensitive to motion changes. Note: If using Region Editor, leave this blank, and set indifference in the Region Editor (below).&amp;#8221; So&amp;#8230; firstly, the semantics of this are awful. Secondly, in my version, the global default (if not using Regions) isn&amp;#8217;t 10 it&amp;#8217;s 0.5, and the per-region default is&amp;nbsp;0.0005.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were also a number of settings visible in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UI&lt;/span&gt; for the version I was running (&lt;a href="https://github.com/ShinobiCCTV/Shinobi/commit/4bf071abb5706f9240f32617bf3bb4b8aa52f3ca"&gt;https://github.com/ShinobiCCTV/Shinobi.git &amp;#8220;dev&amp;#8221; branch 4bf071abb5706f9240f32617bf3bb4b8aa52f3ca&lt;/a&gt;) that weren&amp;#8217;t in the&amp;nbsp;documentation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Allow Next Trigger&lt;/strong&gt; - &amp;#8220;in Milliseconds&amp;#8221;, default&amp;nbsp;2000.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Send Events to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SQL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; - &amp;#8220;Save Motion Events in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SQL&lt;/span&gt;. This will allow display of motion over video during the time motion events occured [sic] in the Power Viewer.&amp;#8221; As I found out later, the Power Viewer does barely anything without&amp;nbsp;this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After configuring the detection settings, the documentation told me that I had to add regions (zones) or else the detection would use the full frame. I did that via an editor modal from the Monitor Settings which allows adding multiple region polygons to the video via a simple but somewhat jerky and annoying (drag too close to the edges and points won&amp;#8217;t stick there) polygon editor. It was supposed to show the live video stream under the polygon, but that only worked once or twice for me, usually being a brown box where the video should&amp;nbsp;be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was happy to see that running almost-full-frame, 15fps motion detection on both video feeds was only using about &lt;span class="caps"&gt;400MB&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RAM&lt;/span&gt; and the equivalent of one core (on my host &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OS&lt;/span&gt; it showed all 8 cores running around 20%, which is pretty good since I was also running graphite, grafana, nginx, apache, MySQL, Chrome, Atom,&amp;nbsp;etc.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing I immediately noticed after enabling motion detection, though, is that there&amp;#8217;s no &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UI&lt;/span&gt; indication of motion events. To see motion events for a camera, you need to use the Calendar, Video List, or Power Viewer modals. The other thing I noticed immediately is that using the default &amp;#8220;indifference&amp;#8221; value, my outdoor camera was recording constantly. I tried adjusting this value on both cameras but it certainly wasn&amp;#8217;t scientific; the default indifference for a zone was &amp;#8220;0.0005&amp;#8221; so I tried increasing it (decreasing sensitivity) by powers of 10. The best I could get that way was a point where almost everything was recorded, and then another point where it never&amp;nbsp;triggered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that experience, I turned to the &amp;#8220;Power Viewer&amp;#8221; which seemed like it might be able to solve this. The layout actually seems quite well done and useful, despite the fact that the Live View of the camera was only sporadically working for&amp;nbsp;me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/GFX/shinobi5.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="screenshot of Shinobi Power Viewer" src="/GFX/shinobi5_sm.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main elements&amp;nbsp;are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Live View&lt;/strong&gt; - This only worked sporadically for me, and I was unable to get a screenshot of it. When it worked, it showed the live stream from the&amp;nbsp;camera.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Timeline&lt;/strong&gt; - A relatively handy view of all recordings and motion events for the specified date range. It seems to default to two days, though I only had the system running and recording for an hour or so. The blue dots along the timeline represent recordings; clicking one of them brings up the recording and starts playing it. The red bars represent the count of motion detection events in each&amp;nbsp;recording.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recording&lt;/strong&gt; - Plays the selected recording along with displaying the&amp;nbsp;filename.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Playback Timer&lt;/strong&gt; - It&amp;#8217;s a simple playback timer for the currently-playing video. It&amp;#8217;s clickable and draggable to advance through the&amp;nbsp;video.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Motion Meter&lt;/strong&gt; - The tooltip for this says &amp;#8220;Motion Meter&amp;#8221;, and the only clear documentation I could find on this says, &amp;#8220;When motion occurs a red bar will appear under your stream to indicate how much motion has happened.&amp;#8221; Some other documentation &lt;em&gt;implies&lt;/em&gt; that this should be the detected indifference value, presumably on a scale of zero to 100, but nothing explains that specifically. This also appeared to lag quite a bit behind the video and doesn&amp;#8217;t have a numeric output even on&amp;nbsp;hover.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Motion Confidence&lt;/strong&gt; - This is a graph over time (for the currently-playing recording) of &amp;#8220;Motion Confidence&amp;#8221;. I was unable to find any reference to this in the documentation and haven&amp;#8217;t yet received a response to my &lt;a href="https://forum.shinobi.video/topic/216/relationship-between-indifference-and-motion-confidence"&gt;forum post&lt;/a&gt; asking about it. The numeric definitely seems different from the &amp;#8220;Motion Meter&amp;#8221; to me, but I don&amp;#8217;t know what it&amp;nbsp;means.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point it seemed like Shinobi was the frontrunner in everything except motion detection, which it seemed to fail horribly at. There&amp;#8217;s a Noise Filter setting that I tried, but I couldn&amp;#8217;t find any clear documentation on how to tune Shinobi for motion thresholds and it certainly seemed to lack many of the advanced tuning features of &lt;code&gt;motion&lt;/code&gt; such as imprinting the number of changed pixels in the frame, debug images/videos with motion highlighted, adaptive thresholds or blob detection. I decided that I might as well explore &lt;code&gt;motion&lt;/code&gt; since I understand it and it&amp;#8217;s well documented, and come back to Shinobi later if I want&amp;nbsp;to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Postscript:&lt;/strong&gt; Some of my other notes on&amp;nbsp;Shinobi:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One feature I do like about Shinobi is the &amp;#8220;Delete Motionless&amp;#8221; toggle that apparently records all the time and then deletes recording segments that didn&amp;#8217;t have motion detected. This seems like a &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; good idea and, if done right, could help with capturing the low-motion events leading up to an event that crosses the&amp;nbsp;threshold.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There were some annoying timezone bugs, where the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UI&lt;/span&gt; showed the time in my local timezone (including the clock in the upper right corner) but the filenames and Power Viewer were using&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;UTC&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="motion"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#motion"&gt;Motion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve used the &lt;a href="https://motion-project.github.io/"&gt;Motion Project&lt;/a&gt; a few times over the years and had a pretty good impression of it - at one point I had it running motion detection with a 1080P webcam on an original Raspberry Pi Model B (700MHz &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ARM&lt;/span&gt; with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;512MB&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RAM&lt;/span&gt;). It&amp;#8217;s an established project (the git history goes back to 2005, but the initial commit is &amp;#8220;initial import&amp;#8221;), written in C and highly performant, and follows the Unix philosophy of doing one thing and doing it well. The project has been recently taken over by new developers and has a new home in the &lt;a href="https://github.com/Motion-Project"&gt;Motion-Project GitHub org&lt;/a&gt; but the previous maintainer&amp;#8217;s amazingly detailed and helpful wiki is still available at &lt;a href="http://www.lavrsen.dk/foswiki/bin/view/Motion/WebHome"&gt;http://www.lavrsen.dk/foswiki/bin/view/Motion/WebHome&lt;/a&gt;. Also note that I&amp;#8217;m not sure about the other projects listed here, but Motion uses luminance / intensity only to detect motion, i.e. no color&amp;nbsp;information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main things that I remember about Motion from using it in the past (aside from feeling somewhat archaic though amazingly stable and fast)&amp;nbsp;are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tuning of thresholds as a number of changed&amp;nbsp;pixels.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For tuning, the ability to output &amp;#8220;debug&amp;#8221; images showing only the pixels that triggered motion&amp;nbsp;detection.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Output as videos and/or &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JPEG&lt;/span&gt; snapshots, but it handles everything internally as still&amp;nbsp;frames.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to mask off certain parts of the frame using a manually-generated mask&amp;nbsp;image.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to watermark every frame with the number of changes pixels, for&amp;nbsp;debugging/tuning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Lightswitch mode&amp;#8221; that automatically ignores massive changes in&amp;nbsp;brightness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Motion detection based on the largest contiguous region of changed pixels, so it&amp;#8217;s less effected by&amp;nbsp;wind/leaves/rain/etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Support for multiple&amp;nbsp;cameras.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Snapshots either on a regular interval automatically, or triggered by a&amp;nbsp;signal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to execute arbitrary programs/scripts when events occur (&lt;em&gt;many&lt;/em&gt; events; motion detect start and end, pictures and movies being written, event start and end,&amp;nbsp;etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Built-in ability to write extremely detailed information to&amp;nbsp;MySQL/PostgreSQL/SQLite3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Highly configurable picture/video paths/filenames and overlay of text on&amp;nbsp;images.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently since I last looked at the project, a number of major new features have been introduced&amp;nbsp;including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Live streaming of incoming cam video via &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTTP&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;MJPEG&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Motion tracking in the frame, and experimental control of tracking motion via pan/tilt camera&amp;nbsp;controls.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Control via a simple web interface, even including the ability to change/tune many settings live from the web&amp;nbsp;interface.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Automatic/adaptive noise and threshold&amp;nbsp;control.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Official support for both the RaspberryPi and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MUSL&lt;/span&gt; LibC (i.e. Alpine&amp;nbsp;Linux)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project also has wonderfully detailed documentation, as well as active &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IRC&lt;/span&gt; and mailing&amp;nbsp;lists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Motion only has a very basic web interface for control, there are a number of more full-featured web UIs for it including the quite popular &lt;a href="https://github.com/ccrisan/motioneye"&gt;MotionEye&lt;/a&gt; that uses Python and&amp;nbsp;Tornado.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After my frustrations with ZoneMinder, Kerberos.io, and Shinobi, I believe I&amp;#8217;m going to be going the minimalist route and using Motion with some sort of web &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UI&lt;/span&gt; for motion detection, recording, and review, and the cameras&amp;#8217; built-in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RSTP&lt;/span&gt; stream for high-resolution live viewing. Given how long this post ended up being, I&amp;#8217;ll save the Motion setup and testing for my next&amp;nbsp;installment.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="amcrest"></category><category term="camera"></category><category term="security"></category><category term="surveillance"></category><category term="video"></category><category term="linux"></category><category term="IP camera"></category><category term="evaluation"></category></entry><entry><title>Amcrest IP Camera First Impressions</title><link href="https://blog.jasonantman.com/2018/05/amcrest-ip-camera-first-impressions/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-05-06T20:13:00-04:00</published><updated>2018-05-06T20:13:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Jason Antman</name></author><id>tag:blog.jasonantman.com,2018-05-06:/2018/05/amcrest-ip-camera-first-impressions/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;My first impressions on interfacing with Amcrest &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IP&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;cameras&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;!--- remove this next line to disable Table of Contents --&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m going to be moving to a new area at the end of the month and will be leaving my dogs home alone during the days I work in the office - and my home unattended - on a regular basis for the first time. While the neighborhood I&amp;#8217;m moving to seems safe, I wanted some peace of mind about both the security of my new home and the well-being of my dogs when I&amp;#8217;m out. While I&amp;#8217;ve set up a &lt;a href="https://blog.jasonantman.com/2016/01/raspberry-pi-security-system/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DIY&lt;/span&gt; RaspberryPi-based security system&lt;/a&gt; in a past apartment, that won&amp;#8217;t help knowing that my dogs are doing &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt; (and the house I&amp;#8217;m moving to isn&amp;#8217;t wired for a security system). While I may look into setting up a security system in the future (likely based on &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-Wave"&gt;Z-Wave&lt;/a&gt; wireless components), I decided that some &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IP&lt;/span&gt;-based surveillance cameras are the best way to achieve my short-term need. I recently bought some of them, and want to share my&amp;nbsp;experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; The next post in this series is up, &lt;a href="/2018/05/linux-surveillance-camera-software-evaluation"&gt;Linux Surveillance Camera Software Evaluation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="devices-and-purchase"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#devices-and-purchase"&gt;Devices and&amp;nbsp;Purchase&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started my search with the hardware compatibility lists of &lt;a href="http://www.lavrsen.dk/foswiki/bin/view/Motion/WorkingDevices"&gt;Motion&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://wiki.zoneminder.com/Hardware_Compatibility_List"&gt;ZoneMinder&lt;/a&gt;, the most well-known (albeit rather aged) open source video motion detection projects. I figured that most likely I&amp;#8217;d be using one of these to detect and alert on motion; I&amp;#8217;ve used Motion before quite successfully but it is a daemon only whereas ZoneMinder offers a full web interface. The outcome of my research was that most decent modern &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IP&lt;/span&gt;-based surveillance cameras support the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ONVIF"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ONVIF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; interoperability standard, and almost any camera that supports &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ONVIF&lt;/span&gt; and third-party clients (i.e. unencrypted video streams) should&amp;nbsp;work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided that I&amp;#8217;d get three initial cameras for some tests: an indoor camera with remote pan and tilt to keep an eye on the dogs and two outdoor fixed cameras, one wireless and one wired with Power over Ethernet (PoE) support. I currently have a very good 5GHz wireless access point (a &lt;a href="https://www.ubnt.com/airmax/nanostationm/"&gt;Uniquiti NanoStation M&lt;/a&gt;) and a serviceable but nine-year-old 2.4 GHz 802.11b/g Ubiquiti PicoStation 2. Unfortunately, I&amp;#8217;ve been unable to find &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; reasonably-priced 5GHz &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IP&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;cameras.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My initial desire was to get only 1080p cameras, but I decided to try a 960p wireless model given my aged access point. After a few hours of browsing on Amazon I settled on buying the following three cameras, all of which claimed &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ONVIF&lt;/span&gt; support and support for third-party video management&amp;nbsp;systems:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01G1U4MVA/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SV3C&lt;/span&gt; V-B01-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;1080PL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; 1080P wired outdoor camera with PoE&amp;nbsp;support&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01I00987C/"&gt;Amcrest &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IPM&lt;/span&gt;-723W&lt;/a&gt; 2.4GHz wireless 960P outdoor camera (shipped with latest firmware, &lt;code&gt;2.400.AC02.15.R,build:2017-07-31&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0145OQTPG/"&gt;Amcrest &amp;#8220;ProHD&amp;#8221; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IP2M&lt;/span&gt;-841B&lt;/a&gt; 2.4GHz (or wired) 1080p indoor pan/tilt camera (shipped with latest firmware, &lt;code&gt;2.520.AC00.18.R,build:2017-06-29&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of them support wired Ethernet in addition to WiFi. They&amp;#8217;re all highly reviewed on Amazon with a number of positive reviews mentioning Linux. My choice of the Amcrest cameras was based largely on a number of very positive reviews from other people using Linux and/or leveraging their APIs and on the availability of a detailed &lt;a href="https://support.amcrest.com/hc/en-us/articles/232310528-Amcrest-HTTP-API-SDK"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTTP&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; document&lt;/a&gt; on Amcrest&amp;#8217;s site. The Amcrest &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; document specifically mentioned &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTTP&lt;/span&gt; Basic authentication, which I considered a plus since I could easily add the required headers in an Nginx reverse proxy and use my own authentication methods for remote&amp;nbsp;access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After unboxing the Amcrest cameras and experimenting with them a bit, I decided to return the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SV3C&lt;/span&gt; camera unopened. It was clear to me that if I wanted to use Amcrest&amp;#8217;s &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTTP&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt;, it would make sense to stick with the cameras from one manufacturer. Since &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SV3C&lt;/span&gt; didn&amp;#8217;t even have any &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; documentation that I could find, Amcrest won. The rest of this post will discuss my initial exploration of the Amcrest&amp;nbsp;cameras.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="initial-setup"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#initial-setup"&gt;Initial&amp;nbsp;Setup&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Amcrest seemed to be well-reviewed, I&amp;#8217;m always very hesitant to put new devices on my network, especially if they&amp;#8217;re running opaque proprietary firmware. And even more so if they have &amp;#8220;cloud&amp;#8221; features (as Amcrest does) that imply remote access which I&amp;#8217;d need to trust the manufacturer to properly secure and allow me to disable. &lt;a href="https://blog.jessfraz.com/post/home-lab-is-the-dopest-lab/"&gt;Jess Frazelle&amp;#8217;s Home Lab blog post&lt;/a&gt;, along with some great reviews from my colleague &lt;a href="https://github.com/jniesen"&gt;jniesen&lt;/a&gt;, spurred me to plan replacing my almost-decade-old Ubiquiti access points with some new ones that support BSSIDs and 802.1q VLANs, but until I do I&amp;#8217;m still stuck with a single &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SSID&lt;/span&gt; and flat&amp;nbsp;network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, my initial unboxing process for each camera was as&amp;nbsp;follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Plug in to my MacBook with a crossover cable and Wireshark running; power on the camera and record the wired Ethernet &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MAC&lt;/span&gt; address for the camera. Then power off the&amp;nbsp;camera.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On my &lt;a href="http://www.vyos.io/"&gt;VyOS&lt;/a&gt; router, assign the camera&amp;#8217;s wired &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MAC&lt;/span&gt; a static &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IP&lt;/span&gt; and local&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DNS&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alter my firewall rules to reject all traffic from the camera to the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WAN&lt;/span&gt;, so it can&amp;#8217;t phone home or send anything directly to the external&amp;nbsp;world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Plug the camera in to my switch and power it on. Wait a few minutes and then access the builtin &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTTP&lt;/span&gt; web interface at the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IP&lt;/span&gt; I&amp;nbsp;assigned.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Log in with the default username/password (admin/admin) and change the&amp;nbsp;password.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Browse through the &amp;#8220;setup&amp;#8221; portion of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UI&lt;/span&gt; and record some of the current/default settings and&amp;nbsp;information:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Information&amp;#8221; -&amp;gt; &amp;#8220;Version&amp;#8221; - record all&amp;nbsp;versions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Camera&amp;#8221; -&amp;gt; &amp;#8220;Video&amp;#8221; - record streaming and snapshot settings; change Overlay to the camera&amp;#8217;s hostname and the Sub Stream to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MJPEG&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VGA&lt;/span&gt;, 5&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;FPS&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Camera&amp;#8221; -&amp;gt; &amp;#8220;Audio&amp;#8221; (on ProHD) - record stream&amp;nbsp;information&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Network&amp;#8221; -&amp;gt; &amp;#8220;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TCP&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;IP&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8221; - change hostname; record wireless &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MAC&lt;/span&gt;; disable&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;P2P&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Network&amp;#8221; -&amp;gt; &amp;#8220;Connection&amp;#8221; - record all ports; ensure &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ONVIF&lt;/span&gt; authentication is&amp;nbsp;enabled&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Network&amp;#8221; -&amp;gt; (&amp;#8220;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DDNS&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8221;, &amp;#8220;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;IP&lt;/span&gt; Filter&amp;#8221;, &amp;#8220;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SMTP&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8221;, &amp;#8220;UPnP&amp;#8221;) - ensure all are&amp;nbsp;disabled&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Network&amp;#8221; -&amp;gt; &amp;#8220;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SNMP&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8221; (if present) - enable&amp;nbsp;v1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Network&amp;#8221; -&amp;gt; (&amp;#8220;Bonjour&amp;#8221;, &amp;#8220;Multicast&amp;#8221;, &amp;#8220;802.1x&amp;#8221;, &amp;#8220;QoS&amp;#8221;, &amp;#8220;HTTPs&amp;#8221;) - ensure all are&amp;nbsp;disabled&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;System&amp;#8221; -&amp;gt; &amp;#8220;General&amp;#8221; -&amp;gt; &amp;#8220;Date &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Time&amp;#8221; - enable&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NTP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;System&amp;#8221; -&amp;gt; &amp;#8220;Export&amp;#8221; - export a configuration file and save&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Event&amp;#8221; - disable all of them for&amp;nbsp;now&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that, I added the wireless &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MAC&lt;/span&gt; address for the camera to my access point&amp;#8217;s &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ACL&lt;/span&gt; and then set up a static &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IP&lt;/span&gt;, local &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DNS&lt;/span&gt;, and outbound traffic reject the same way I did for the wired &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MAC&lt;/span&gt;. I then configured the WiFi connection in the camera&amp;#8217;s Setup &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UI&lt;/span&gt;, ensured it connected to the network properly, and unplugged the wired&amp;nbsp;Ethernet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="chrome-app"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#chrome-app"&gt;Chrome&amp;nbsp;App&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing I noted in the web &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UI&lt;/span&gt; in Chrome is the high-res H.264 video stream was unavailable, displaying a &amp;#8220;Please click here to download and install the plug-in&amp;#8221; link. I was amazingly happy to find that this link brought me to the &lt;a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/amcrest-web-view/oddndbjhpcpopbebhonolceinkbnheih?hl=en-US"&gt;Amcrest Web View&lt;/a&gt; Chrome App, which actually works with Linux. The Chrome App really just seems to wrap the existing web &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UI&lt;/span&gt; while providing the required plug-in, but it works fine in Chrome on Linux. I&amp;#8217;m vaguely concerned about the Chrome App being another data exfiltration or phone-home avenue, but for initial testing I was willing to take that risk. The App worked quite nicely, streaming near-realtime and very fluid, high-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;FPS&lt;/span&gt; images from both the 960P and 1080P cameras over WiFi, and gave me smooth, natural control of the pan and tilt for the ProHD&amp;nbsp;camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="api-and-digest-auth"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#api-and-digest-auth"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; and Digest&amp;nbsp;Auth&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next I wanted to dive right into the documented &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CGI&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt;, and had even prepared a few curl commands for the basics (according to the &lt;a href="https://support.amcrest.com/hc/en-us/articles/232310528-Amcrest-HTTP-API-SDK"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; document&lt;/a&gt; on Amcrest&amp;#8217;s site) before I even got the cameras. Unfortunately, they all failed with 401 Unauthorized errors. After some investigation and a trip to the &lt;a href="https://amcrest.com/forum/technical-discussion-f3/"&gt;Amcrest Technical Forums&lt;/a&gt;, I found that recent firmware versions dropped support for Basic authentication in favor of only Digest. This was confirmed by &lt;a href="https://amcrest.com/forum/technical-discussion-f3/cgi-sdk-no-longer-functioning-on-17r--t2401.html"&gt;multiple&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://amcrest.com/forum/technical-discussion-f3/basic-http-auth-not-working-after-firmware-update--t2771.html"&gt;threads&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://amcrest.com/forum/technical-discussion-f3/http-api-authentication-via-url-t3899.html"&gt;on&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://amcrest.com/forum/technical-discussion-f3/authentication-examples--t7128.html"&gt;the&lt;/a&gt; forum. This was quite problematic for my plans, since &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digest_access_authentication"&gt;Digest authentication&lt;/a&gt; is significantly more complicated than Basic and relies on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MD5&lt;/span&gt; hashes generated on the client that include various fields sent in the headers of the server 401 response. In short, there doesn&amp;#8217;t seem to be any common reverse proxy (I checked Nginx, Apache, Lighttpd, and HAproxy) that supports Digest authentication to the backend/upstream. So my plans of wrapping the cameras in my own security (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TLS&lt;/span&gt; and client certificate authentication in Nginx, with Nginx adding the appropriate Basic auth headers during the proxy process) weren&amp;#8217;t working out so well - the best I could get is a combination of the authentication I enabled in Nginx, plus Digest authentication to each&amp;nbsp;stream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent the better part of two afternoons and evenings looking into this and trying to develop a workaround. The &lt;a href="https://amcrest.com/forum/technical-discussion-f3/cgi-sdk-no-longer-functioning-on-17r--t2401.html"&gt;main Amcrest forum thread&lt;/a&gt; about this didn&amp;#8217;t have a whole lot of information other than many frustrated customers broken by the latest firmware upgrade (without even a corresponding &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; documentation update; the latest &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; docs still listed support for both Basic and Digest) and a few people who received unhelpful support responses. I opened my own support ticket about the problem, stating that I&amp;#8217;d purchased the cameras based on the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; documentation and planned to integrate them with a system that only supports Basic authentication. I received a response the next day, stating in&amp;nbsp;part:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am sorry for the bad information you got about our cameras. You are correct, Basic Authentication is no longer supported on our &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IP&lt;/span&gt; Cameras, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NVR&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DVR&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s since latest firmware&amp;nbsp;updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was an intended decision as our developer decided to move away from Basic Authentication due to major security concern. Our devices will work only on Digest Authentication from now on. We did suggest our product management team and developers to re-enable Basic Authentication as some sort of &amp;#8220;optional&amp;#8221; feature able to be disabled by the user. However, this suggestion was&amp;nbsp;dismissed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best situation for you at this point is to send back the cameras as, as stated, they won&amp;#8217;t work with Basic&amp;nbsp;Authentication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s worth pointing out at this point that the recent firmware versions for these cameras include &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTTPS&lt;/span&gt; support, and even include support for either uploading your own &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TLS&lt;/span&gt; cert and key or generating a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CSR&lt;/span&gt; on the camera and then uploading the signed certificate. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TLS&lt;/span&gt; with Basic auth (i.e. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; keys/tokens) is a widely accepted method in the world of public APIs, and would surely be sufficient for devices such as these cameras. In fact, Amcrest runs their own dynamic &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DNS&lt;/span&gt; service for (optional) remote access to cameras, so it should be relatively simple to leverage that and LetsEncrypt for automated certs. Instead - probably spurred on by the archaic &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ONVIF&lt;/span&gt; standard that specifies Digest authentication - they seem to be going the route of alleviating their &amp;#8220;major security concern&amp;#8221; by means of a 25-year-old authentication system based on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MD5&lt;/span&gt; hashes, and likely quite easy to break offline given access to a successful authentication exchange and a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPU&lt;/span&gt;-based &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EC2&lt;/span&gt; instance (not to mention simple to&amp;nbsp;man-in-the-middle).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, being the obsessive person that I am, I started thinking about how to fix this. I went through the usual suspects for reverse proxying - Nginx, Apache, HAproxy, Lighttpd, etc. - and couldn&amp;#8217;t find any examples of existing solutions to handle Digest authentication for the upstream. While it would probably be &lt;em&gt;possible&lt;/em&gt;, most of my recent programming experience is in Python and Ruby with a handful of Groovy and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JS&lt;/span&gt;, and none of those seemed to fit the bill. I spent a bit of time looking at simple &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTTP&lt;/span&gt; proxy solutions in languages that I know (or at least sort-of know) and found the &lt;a href="https://github.com/nodejitsu/node-http-proxy"&gt;nodejitsu/node-http-proxy&lt;/a&gt; project. With a bit of experimentation I was able to get that working for the simple text-based &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; URLs but (as expected, looking at the source) it failed completely for the secondary &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MJPEG&lt;/span&gt; streams. I found and tried &lt;a href="https://github.com/legege/node-mjpeg-proxy"&gt;node-mjpeg-proxy&lt;/a&gt; next, but was unable to get it working&amp;nbsp;satisfactorily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all of those experiments and research I decided that I should stop looking for an exsiting solution or magic bullet and go back to what I know best: Python. After only a few minutes more on Google, I stumbled on a complete gem in the form of a Flask snippet, &lt;a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/snippets/118/"&gt;Stream Proxy with Requests&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;flask&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Flask&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;flask&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Response&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;flask&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;stream_with_context&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;requests&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Flask&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="vm"&gt;__name__&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nd"&gt;@app.route&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;/&amp;lt;path:url&amp;gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;home&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;requests&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;stream&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;stream_with_context&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;iter_content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;content_type&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;req&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;headers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;content-type&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="vm"&gt;__name__&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;__main__&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;run&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h2 id="python-digest-auth-removing-proxy"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#python-digest-auth-removing-proxy"&gt;Python Digest-Auth-Removing&amp;nbsp;Proxy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting with the above snippet using &lt;a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/"&gt;Flask&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/"&gt;requests&lt;/a&gt; - two Python packages that I&amp;#8217;m quite familiar with - I was able to quickly add the Digest authentication option to the requests call and achieve a working, auth-less &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MJPEG&lt;/span&gt; stream from the camera. With a bit of tuning, I came up with a rough proof-of-concept that provided unauthenticated access to the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MJPEG&lt;/span&gt; stream and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CGI&lt;/span&gt;-based &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; (including snapshots and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PTZ&lt;/span&gt; control) simultaneously via multiple workers. It&amp;#8217;s not amazing; running on my desktop the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MJPEG&lt;/span&gt; stream suffers some pretty bad latency that gets even worse when other &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CGI&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; endpoints are used simultaneously (I suspect this may be a problem on the camera&amp;nbsp;itself).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that this does not proxy either non-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;MJPEG&lt;/span&gt; streams (i.e. the high-resolution &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RSTP&lt;/span&gt; stream) or the built-in web &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UI&lt;/span&gt; itself (which relies on client-side javascript XMLHttpRequest and cookies for&amp;nbsp;login).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the time being I&amp;#8217;m not sure if I&amp;#8217;m even going to use this proxy, but for anyone who&amp;#8217;s interested, the code is &lt;a href="https://github.com/jantman/python-amcrest-noauth-proxy"&gt;on GitHub&lt;/a&gt; along with a ready-to-run &lt;a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/jantman/python-amcrest-noauth-proxy/"&gt;Docker image&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="json-configuration-backups"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#json-configuration-backups"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;JSON&lt;/span&gt; Configuration&amp;nbsp;Backups&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While looking into the Digest authentication changes, I used the configuration export/backup functionality (Export via the Setup web &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UI&lt;/span&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;/cgi-bin/Config.backup?action=All&lt;/code&gt; via the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; for a more detailed config) to see if there was a chance that Digest/Basic was hidden somewhere in the config. It&amp;#8217;s not, but I was pleasantly surprised to see that the exported configuration file was plain and cleanly-deserializable &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JSON&lt;/span&gt; (even pretty-printed). This definitely makes it easier to back up configuration to a git repository and track changes over time, or make sweeping changes to defaults for provisioning new&amp;nbsp;cameras.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="api"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#api"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the majority of the last five-plus years of my career, I&amp;#8217;ve worked almost exclusively with software and generally with modern, well-known systems and services. Coming from a ReST-ful world, the Amcrest cameras&amp;#8217; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; was a bit of a shock and trip back in time for me. While the current version (2.12) of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; documentation calls it a &amp;#8220;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTTP&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8221;, the filename of the previous version that I found (1.51) is much more accurate: &lt;a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/amcrest-files/AMCREST_CGI_SDK_API.pdf"&gt;AMCREST_CGI_SDK_API.pdf&lt;/a&gt;. While functional, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; appears to be a minimum-effort project to wrap (likely existing) system tooling on the camera in some sort of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTTP&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt;. Some pertinent pieces of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; specification&amp;nbsp;include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aside from &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RSTP&lt;/span&gt; streams, all paths are to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CGI&lt;/span&gt; scripts - i.e. &lt;code&gt;/cgi-bin/mjpg/video.cgi&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;/cgi-bin/configManager.cgi&lt;/code&gt;,&amp;nbsp;etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many of the paths use query parameters that sound like they map to command-line arguments, i.e. &lt;code&gt;/cgi-bin/configManager.cgi?action=getConfig&amp;amp;name=Snap&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; specification defines &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTTP&lt;/span&gt; status codes including 200, 400, 404, and 500, it also &lt;em&gt;clearly&lt;/em&gt; states (with examples) that &amp;#8220;fits with syntax but an error occurs while the server handles it&amp;#8221; will result in a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTTP&lt;/span&gt; 200 with a body containing a plain text error&amp;nbsp;message.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; appears to use the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;POST&lt;/span&gt; verb for anything that uploads a file, and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GET&lt;/span&gt; for everything else. URLs that result in configuration changes or pan/tilt/zoom commands are still &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GET&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;requests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For query parameters (which drive the majority of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt;), various &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CGI&lt;/span&gt; paths use either logically-named parameters (e.g. &amp;#8220;channel&amp;#8221;, &amp;#8220;action&amp;#8221;, etc.) or generic ones (&amp;#8220;arg1&amp;#8221;, &amp;#8220;arg2&amp;#8221;, &amp;#8220;arg3&amp;#8221;,&amp;nbsp;etc.).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JSON&lt;/span&gt; configuration file format was a welcome surprise, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; endpoints that return textual responses (as opposed to image/video/audio) respond with line-based key/value pairs separated by equal&amp;nbsp;signs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I imagine that much of this is dictated by needing to support Amcrest&amp;#8217;s network video recorder products, and perhaps some of it is also dictated by their manufacturer Dahua (Amcrest&amp;#8217;s products seem to be running customized and branded Dahua software, and likely hardware too). While much of this &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; is simpler for me to work with than the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SOAP&lt;/span&gt;- and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WSDL&lt;/span&gt;-based &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ONVIF&lt;/span&gt; standard, I&amp;#8217;d still be much happier if the devices exposed a modern ReST/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;JSON&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a Python package, &lt;a href="http://python-amcrest.readthedocs.io/"&gt;python-amcrest&lt;/a&gt;, that claims to provide a native Python client for this &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CGI&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; but I haven&amp;#8217;t tried it&amp;nbsp;yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="alarms-events-initial-research"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#alarms-events-initial-research"&gt;Alarms / Events - Initial&amp;nbsp;Research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These cameras support a number of internal &amp;#8220;alarms&amp;#8221; for events such as motion detection (likely nowhere near as good as Motion or ZoneMinder), video loss, audio detection, failed logins, disk (optional &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SD&lt;/span&gt; card) missing, error or full, network disconnect or &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IP&lt;/span&gt; conflict, or external alarms (the ProHD has four analog relay input/output connections on the back that can be used for either external trigger inputs or outputs). I&amp;#8217;m not concerned with most of them and currently don&amp;#8217;t have &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SD&lt;/span&gt; cards in the cameras, but I am interested in the &amp;#8220;Video Tamper&amp;#8221; alarm that detects loss of picture such as when the lens is obstructed. So, I began a bit of research into what options were available for receiving these alarms. Of course I wasn&amp;#8217;t lucky enough to see a webhook or &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTTP&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GET&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;POST&lt;/span&gt; delivery method, let alone &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SNS&lt;/span&gt; or &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SQS&lt;/span&gt;. The options for alarm handling are recording, triggering one of the relays (on the ProHD that supports them), taking a snapshot, sending email, or polling the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; for alarm events. The ProHD also supposedly supports &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SNMP&lt;/span&gt; traps, though they&amp;#8217;re not explicitly listed as an event&amp;nbsp;action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; Upon review of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; documentation, it appears that it&amp;#8217;s also possible to &amp;#8220;subscribe&amp;#8221; to events via &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTTP&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CGI&lt;/span&gt;. This &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; appears to be a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTTP&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GET&lt;/span&gt; that responds with a &lt;code&gt;multipart/x-mixed-replace&lt;/code&gt; content-type and streams plaintext event descriptions to the client as they occur. The client must send keepalive data to the server every 1 to 60 seconds (helpfully, the doc states that the keepalive data can be the string &amp;#8220;keep&amp;nbsp;alive&amp;#8221;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given those options, I decided that either &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SNMP&lt;/span&gt; or &amp;#8220;email&amp;#8221; (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SMTP&lt;/span&gt;) would be the best bet for programmatically receiving the events and acting on&amp;nbsp;them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="snmp"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#snmp"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SNMP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest firmware for the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IPM&lt;/span&gt;-723W, &amp;#8220;15.R&amp;#8221;, doesn&amp;#8217;t appear to support &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SNMP&lt;/span&gt; at all; it&amp;#8217;s missing the &amp;#8220;Setup&amp;#8221; -&amp;gt; &amp;#8220;Network&amp;#8221; -&amp;gt; &amp;#8220;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SNMP&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8221; configuration that the ProHD running &amp;#8220;18.R&amp;#8221; software has. So it seems like &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SNMP&lt;/span&gt; isn&amp;#8217;t going to be a viable option for me but I wanted to explore it anyway. I enabled &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SNMP&lt;/span&gt; v1 with the default &amp;#8220;public&amp;#8221; read community and issued a quick &lt;code&gt;snmpwalk&lt;/code&gt;. There wasn&amp;#8217;t a whole lot aside from what I&amp;#8217;d expect to find on a typical Linux device (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SNMP&lt;/span&gt;*-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;MIB&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IF&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;MIB&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TCP&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;MIB&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IP&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;MIB&lt;/span&gt;, etc.). The sum of the interesting parts&amp;nbsp;was:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;SNMPv2-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;MIB&lt;/span&gt;::sysORID.10 = &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OID&lt;/span&gt;: SNMPv2-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SMI&lt;/span&gt;::enterprises.1004849.2.1.1

&lt;p&gt;It appears that there are two sets of custom MIBs exposed, one from their manufacturer Dahua and another presumably from Amcrest and claiming to be exposed at &amp;#8220;.0.1&amp;#8221; (ccitt.1). I&amp;#8217;ve been completely unable to get anything out of the Amcrest MIBs (sysORID&amp;#8217;s 15 through 25; ccitt.1) and have presumed them to be broken; the &lt;a href="https://amcrest.com/forum/technical-discussion-f3/snmp-t1045.html"&gt;one thread on the Amcrest forums&lt;/a&gt; about this seems to concur. For the Dahua OIDs, neither Amcrest nor Dahua appear to publish the MIBs but thanks to a &lt;a href="https://github.com/librenms/librenms/issues/8126"&gt;LibreNMS issue&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://ipcamtalk.com/threads/snmp-mib.25434/"&gt;IPcamTalk forum thread&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/homedefense/comments/7n0bhj/dahua_nvr_looking_for_snmp_mib_files/"&gt;reddit post&lt;/a&gt; I was able to find them. The information I got from walking that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OID&lt;/span&gt; tree with the appropriate &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MIB&lt;/span&gt; from those links didn&amp;#8217;t prove terribly&amp;nbsp;useful:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DAHUA&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SNMP&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;MIB&lt;/span&gt;::networkAlarmIndex.1 = &lt;span class="caps"&gt;INTEGER&lt;/span&gt;: 1
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;So&amp;#8230; nothing terribly interesting. I&amp;#8217;m planning on seeing what I can get from the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SNMP&lt;/span&gt; traps, but since only one of my cameras supports them (and they&amp;#8217;re &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UDP&lt;/span&gt;) I&amp;#8217;m not planning on using them for actually receiving&amp;nbsp;events/alarms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="smtp"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#smtp"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SMTP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SNMP&lt;/span&gt; out of the running for receiving alarms, I turned to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SMTP&lt;/span&gt;. The configuration page I was greeted with, as well as its pop-up help page, left me slightly confused and&amp;nbsp;unsettled:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/GFX/amcrest_smtp_config.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="screenshot of Amcrest camera SMTP configuration page and help pop-up" src="/GFX/amcrest_smtp_config_sm.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I finally muddled through the options and poor translation - checking the &amp;#8220;Login Anonymously&amp;#8221; checkbox directly above the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SMTP&lt;/span&gt; username and password actually enables authentication, i.e. disables non-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AUTH&lt;/span&gt;/anonymous &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SMTP&lt;/span&gt; - I found that support for anonymous &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SMTP&lt;/span&gt; (i.e. without &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AUTH&lt;/span&gt;) is completely broken. When setting unchecking the &amp;#8220;Login anonymously&amp;#8221; box (i.e. no &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AUTH&lt;/span&gt;), the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UI&lt;/span&gt; displays the same &amp;#8220;Email test failed&amp;#8221; error message as with bad credentials, but (per Wireshark/tcpdump) it never actually sends &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; traffic to the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SMTP&lt;/span&gt; server at all. I found a &lt;a href="https://amcrest.com/forum/technical-discussion-f3/email-test-always-fails-brand-new-camera-t1104-s10.html"&gt;forum thread&lt;/a&gt; going back &lt;strong&gt;almost two years&lt;/strong&gt; confirming&amp;nbsp;this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I quickly hacked together a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SMTP&lt;/span&gt; server that accepts any credentials and prints the message to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;STDOUT&lt;/span&gt; (based on &lt;a href="https://github.com/bcoe/secure-smtpd"&gt;secure-smtpd&lt;/a&gt;), pointed the camera&amp;#8217;s &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SMTP&lt;/span&gt; settings to it, and then threw a black shirt over the lens of the camera. Within a minute or so, I got the following message via my dummy &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SMTP&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;server:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The second attachment is a full 1920x1080 snapshot of the video. I was a bit confused to see the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UTF&lt;/span&gt;-8 base64-encoded subject, but the base64-decoded Subject is &amp;#8220;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;IPC&lt;/span&gt; Message&amp;#8221; and body text&amp;nbsp;is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Alarm Event: Tamper Detect
Alarm Input Channel: 1
Alarm Start Time(D/M/Y H:M:S): 06/05/2018 15:28:40
Alarm Device Name: AMC00056_24AAF8
Alarm Name:
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;IP&lt;/span&gt; Address: 192.168.0.60
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Since the only alarm/event I really care about is loss of picture, and motion detection software should be able to handle the same task, I&amp;#8217;m going to completely ignore the alarm/event features for now and focus on the camera solely as a video&amp;nbsp;source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="system-logs"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#system-logs"&gt;System&amp;nbsp;logs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cameras keep rudimentary &amp;#8220;system logs&amp;#8221; which include events (e.g. video tamper/video loss) as well as login/logout from the web &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UI&lt;/span&gt; as well as &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt;, configuration saves, and &amp;#8220;Set Time&amp;#8221; events which perplex me as they show web &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UI&lt;/span&gt; client IPs as the source. These logs are available via a searchable table in the web &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UI&lt;/span&gt;, as well as &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CGI&lt;/span&gt; access to either page through logs filtered by date/time or return a &amp;#8220;log backup&amp;#8221; file of all logs between a given start and end time. Unfortunately, they don&amp;#8217;t support syslog or any other remote log&amp;nbsp;aggregation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="gpl-compliance"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#gpl-compliance"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPL&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;Compliance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Between the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SNMP&lt;/span&gt; output and nmap results, as well as some other information exposed in the documentation and user interface, I&amp;#8217;m certain that these devices are running Linux and &lt;a href="https://www.ffmpeg.org/"&gt;FFmpeg&lt;/a&gt; (LGPLv2). I&amp;#8217;ve also seen some things that make it highly likely that they&amp;#8217;re also running &lt;a href="https://busybox.net/"&gt;busybox&lt;/a&gt; (GPLv2) and the other common embedded Linux utilities. However, I was unable to find any open source license information or source code offer in the packaging and printed documentation that came with either camera, or on Amcrest&amp;#8217;s website or user documentation. I&amp;#8217;ve posted a &lt;a href="https://amcrest.com/forum/technical-discussion-f3/source-code-availability--t8163.html"&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; in Amcrest&amp;#8217;s technical discussion forums inquiring about this but don&amp;#8217;t expect much response from them. If I have time, I may try downloading one of the firmware images and doing some simple tests like running it through &lt;code&gt;strings&lt;/code&gt; to see if I can spot any well-known copyright headers. But as far as I can&amp;nbsp;tell,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="auto-maintain"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#auto-maintain"&gt;Auto&amp;nbsp;Maintain&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cameras both came out-of-the-box with the &amp;#8220;Auto maintain&amp;#8221; feature enabled, which&amp;#8230; reboots the cameras automatically once a week. By default, on Thursday mornings just after 3am&amp;nbsp;local.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having spent some time in the past developing embedded Linux network devices, this does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; give me a terribly confident feeling about the&amp;nbsp;software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="status-and-next-steps"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#status-and-next-steps"&gt;Status and Next&amp;nbsp;Steps&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To wrap up, I currently have two Amcrest &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IP&lt;/span&gt; cameras running on my home network; one looking out the front window, and one (indoor pan/tilt) overlooking my dogs&amp;#8217; crates. Now that I have them configured for the basics, I&amp;#8217;m going to attempt to ignore Amcrest&amp;#8217;s irritating software and focus on the cameras solely as video sources. My next steps - hopefully in a follow-up post not too long from now - will&amp;nbsp;include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Evaluation of Linux-based video surveillance recording/streaming/motion detection software, and choosing one to use. This will likely come down to choosing between something with an existing multi-camera web interface (ZoneMinder, or perhaps one of the newer variants) or something to handle motion detection only (Motion, or a modern variant) and cobbling together a simple web &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UI&lt;/span&gt; for streaming and event&amp;nbsp;viewing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experimenting with using &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ONVIF&lt;/span&gt; instead of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CGI&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;interface.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Expermenting with FFmpeg or something else to restream the video instead of trying to remove authentication in a&amp;nbsp;proxy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Possibly using &lt;a href="http://python-amcrest.readthedocs.io/"&gt;python-amcrest&lt;/a&gt; as a wrapper around the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CGI&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;interface.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Figuring out a system to notify me of important events such as motion, video loss, or connectivity loss to a&amp;nbsp;camera.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The cameras support &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SD&lt;/span&gt; cards and a built-in simple &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DVR&lt;/span&gt; feature. I may get cards for them and configure them to record on network connection loss, just as a&amp;nbsp;test.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; The next post in this series is up, &lt;a href="/2018/05/linux-surveillance-camera-software-evaluation"&gt;Linux Surveillance Camera Software Evaluation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="amcrest"></category><category term="camera"></category><category term="security"></category><category term="surveillance"></category><category term="video"></category></entry><entry><title>Tooling for AWS - webhooks to SQS via API Gateway and Lambda</title><link href="https://blog.jasonantman.com/2016/08/tooling-for-aws-webhooks-to-sqs-via-api-gateway-and-lambda/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-08-06T21:38:00-04:00</published><updated>2016-08-06T21:38:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Jason Antman</name></author><id>tag:blog.jasonantman.com,2016-08-06:/2016/08/tooling-for-aws-webhooks-to-sqs-via-api-gateway-and-lambda/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Project I created that uses Python and Terraform to setup an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWS&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; Gateway instance to receive webhooks, and enqueue their content in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SQS&lt;/span&gt; queues via&amp;nbsp;Lambda.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago at work, I was party to two discussions about possible tooling needs, both very low-priority. One was the possible need to sync MarkDown documentation
from GitHub repositories to&amp;#8230; another thing that can hold docs. The other was relating to the new Version 2 Docker Registry, &lt;a href="https://github.com/docker/distribution"&gt;distribution&lt;/a&gt;.
We have some Jenkins jobs that dynamically populate dropdown fields for build parameters with Docker image names and tags, using the &lt;a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Active+Choices+Plugin"&gt;Active Choices Plugin&lt;/a&gt;.
Right now we&amp;#8217;re directly querying the Docker Registry &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; from Groovy, every time the Build With Parameters page is loaded. With the original version 1 Docker Registry,
images were often missing from the results (eek!) but the performance was good. With the switch to the v2 Registry, it takes almost two minutes to load the page.
While brainstorming solutions, we decided that caching the list of images and tags in the Registry was the solution. For bonus points, it would also be nice to
be able to query based on image labels - something that&amp;#8217;s not exposed in the Registry &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; at all. Luckily, the Registry has an option to fire a webhook every time
a new image is&amp;nbsp;pushed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both of these problems have solutions that involve webhooks, from GitHub and Docker Distribution, respectively. They also both involve doing time-consuming things in custom code with the
data in those hooks - transforming MarkDown to another markup and pushing the result to an on-premesis system in the case of GitHub, and &lt;code&gt;pull&lt;/code&gt;ing and inspecting Docker
images in the case of the Registry. As such, the &amp;#8220;typical&amp;#8221; webhook things like &lt;a href="https://zapier.com/"&gt;Zapier&lt;/a&gt; won&amp;#8217;t fit the bill. All I really needed was something to receive webhooks
and push the content of them into a queue. Ideally, it would also be something that would utilize existing services we have, namely&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWS&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After working a bunch of nights and the good part of a weekend, I have a solution: my new &lt;a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/webhook2lambda2sqs"&gt;webhook2lambda2sqs&lt;/a&gt; Python&amp;nbsp;package.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This implements what I think is the cheapest and lowest-overhead solution for anyone with an existing &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWS&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;account:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Setup an &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; Gateway&lt;/a&gt; that receives json &lt;span class="caps"&gt;POST&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GET&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;requests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It passes them to a &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/"&gt;Lambda Function&lt;/a&gt; which pushes the content to one or more &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SQS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; queues, for consumption by an&amp;nbsp;application.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tooling is written in Python, but leverages &lt;a href="https://www.terraform.io/"&gt;HashiCorp&amp;#8217;s Terraform&lt;/a&gt; to actually manage the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWS&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JSON&lt;/span&gt; configuration file as simple&amp;nbsp;as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;{
  &amp;quot;endpoints&amp;quot;: {
    &amp;quot;some_resource_name&amp;quot;: {
      &amp;quot;method&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;POST&lt;/span&gt;&amp;quot;,
      &amp;quot;queues&amp;quot;: [&amp;quot;myqueue&amp;quot;]
    },
  },
}
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;and a single command (&lt;code&gt;webhook2lambda2sqs genapply&lt;/code&gt;), you&amp;#8217;ll have the complete system up and running, receiving &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTTP&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;POST&lt;/span&gt; requests
at an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWS&lt;/span&gt;-generated &lt;span class="caps"&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt; and pushing them into the &lt;code&gt;myqueue&lt;/code&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SQS&lt;/span&gt; queue. Best of all, going by my testing (this is based on the time
the Lambda function takes to run, which can vary quite a bit), the whole thing is &lt;strong&gt;free for the first 1 million requests per month&lt;/strong&gt;
if your account is still on the Free Tier, and otherwise is less than $4/month for the first million&amp;nbsp;requests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The configuration can handle setting up multiple distinct endpoint paths in the same &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; Gateway, each
sending the data to one or more &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SQS&lt;/span&gt; queues. It also has options for enabling logging (to CloudWatch Logs) both in the function
and on the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; Gateway, pushing &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; Gateway metrics to CloudWatch, and configuring rate&amp;nbsp;limiting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;webhook2lambda2sqs&lt;/code&gt; program generates the Python code for the lambda function and packages it correctly for Lambda, and
then generates a Terraform configuration to manage all required &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWS&lt;/span&gt; resources. Separate commands are available that wrap Terraform
(mainly to deal with some issues with its &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; Gateway implementation) to run &lt;code&gt;plan&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;apply&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;destroy&lt;/code&gt;. There are
also helper commands to view the Lambda Function and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; Gateway logs from CloudWatch, view messages in the queue(s) and
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GET&lt;/span&gt; or &lt;span class="caps"&gt;POST&lt;/span&gt; a test message to one or all of the&amp;nbsp;endpoints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/"&gt;CloudFormation&lt;/a&gt; to manage complete application stacks. One
side-effect of this is that we went through a few periods where we were constantly hitting various
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWS&lt;/span&gt; Service Limits - subnet groups, ElastiCache clusters, security groups, and a whole slew of others.
In pretty much all these cases, we weren&amp;#8217;t &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; aware of the limits; we (the Tooling and
Automation team) had succeeded in our goal of handing our internal customers the tools to spin up
complete application environments, per-developer, on-demand. And it was wonderful until we hit some
magic number of CloudFormation stacks, at which point almost every day for a week or two we had to
open a new &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWS&lt;/span&gt; Support ticket to have a different limit increased, and deal with completely broken
deploys until that was done (or send out a frantic &amp;#8220;someone please delete a dev stack&amp;#8221;&amp;nbsp;email).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early last month we decided that we had to do something about this. As much as I tried, I couldn&amp;#8217;t
find an existing solution that would monitor our limits and alert us when we approached them; there
were some open source scripts that would do so for a handful of limits (generally just &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EC2&lt;/span&gt; usage),
and the proprietary solutions that I was able to find didn&amp;#8217;t seem much better; none of them stated
that they handle &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VPC&lt;/span&gt; or ElastiCache limits, which had been problematic for us. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWS&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s own
&lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/trustedadvisor/"&gt;Trusted Advisor&lt;/a&gt; has a Service Limits
check available to Business- and Enterprise-level support accounts, but it only monitors 17 of the
94 Service Limits that we identified as relevant to us, and it sends out &lt;em&gt;weekly&lt;/em&gt; alerts. So,
I decided to write something to solve the problem. My co-workers and I have been trying to get
corporate legal approval to release our work publicly under an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OSI&lt;/span&gt;-approved license for years,
to no avail. I asked my team if they&amp;#8217;d support waiting a while for this work, so I could do it
entirely in my own time, publicly, under an open source license. Happily, they&amp;nbsp;agreed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I&amp;#8217;m making the first release of &lt;a href="https://github.com/jantman/awslimitchecker"&gt;awslimitchecker&lt;/a&gt;,
an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AGPL&lt;/span&gt; 3.0-licensed Python tool to calculate your &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWS&lt;/span&gt; resource usage for various services bound by
&lt;a href="http://awslimitchecker.readthedocs.org/en/latest/limits.html#current-checks"&gt;service limits&lt;/a&gt;, and tell you which ones exceed a given threshold (actually, warning and critical
thresholds). Effective limits are hard-coded to the &lt;a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_service_limits.html"&gt;published defaults&lt;/a&gt;,
but can be overridden in cases where you&amp;#8217;ve received limit increases, and will be automatically updated
from Trusted Advisor data for all limits that it monitors (if your account includes the full &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TA&lt;/span&gt; checks).
awslimitchecker provides warning and critical thresholds that can be set globally as a percentage of the
limit (defaults are 80% and 99%, respectively) or overridden on a per-limit basis, as either a percentage
or a fixed integer usage&amp;nbsp;value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;awslimitchecker is available &lt;a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/awslimitchecker/0.1.0"&gt;from pypi&lt;/a&gt;.
It is compatible and tested with Python versions 2.6 through 3.4, though the library it uses to communicate
with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWS&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;a href="http://boto.readthedocs.org/en/latest/"&gt;boto&lt;/a&gt;, still has a few &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWS&lt;/span&gt; services which are not python3-compatible.
awslimitchecker includes both a Python module with a &lt;a href="http://awslimitchecker.readthedocs.org/en/latest/awslimitchecker.checker.html"&gt;documented &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for those who
don&amp;#8217;t mind working with Python, and a command line script for those who&amp;nbsp;do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project is still very young, and only being used by one organization, but it&amp;#8217;s proven
stable for us, and I&amp;#8217;m more than happy to accept questions, comments, criticisms,
&lt;a href="https://github.com/jantman/awslimitchecker/issues"&gt;issues/feature requests&lt;/a&gt; and Pull&amp;nbsp;Requests.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="aws"></category><category term="ec2"></category><category term="limits"></category><category term="python"></category><category term="awslimitchecker"></category><category term="cloud"></category></entry><entry><title>Some Additional Serverspec Types</title><link href="https://blog.jasonantman.com/2015/03/some-additional-serverspec-types/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-03-14T11:58:00-04:00</published><updated>2015-03-14T11:58:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Jason Antman</name></author><id>tag:blog.jasonantman.com,2015-03-14:/2015/03/some-additional-serverspec-types/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Some additional types that I wrote for&amp;nbsp;Serverspec&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://serverspec.org/"&gt;Serverspec&lt;/a&gt; is an rspec-based framework for testing live machines,
and making assertions about things like the output of commands, installed packages, running
services, file content, etc. However, it has a relatively limited and basic set of
&lt;a href="http://serverspec.org/resource_types.html"&gt;Resource Types&lt;/a&gt; that it can test&amp;nbsp;for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before Serverspec completely disabled their GitHub issue tracker (they now seem to have no
issue tracker at all), I&amp;#8217;d suggested some improvements for more advanced resource types,
such as one that can perform an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTTP&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GET&lt;/span&gt; against an application and check the status code
and/or output. I was told in no uncertain terms that this is a task for application integration
testing, and that it&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;not what Serverspec is&amp;nbsp;for.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I humbly disagree. I&amp;#8217;ve begun migrating my &lt;a href="https://www.linode.com/"&gt;Linode&lt;/a&gt; to an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EC2&lt;/span&gt; machine,
using some technology that I&amp;#8217;ve been using at my day job; specifically, Puppet to configure the
machine and &lt;a href="https://packer.io/"&gt;Packer&lt;/a&gt; to build an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AMI&lt;/span&gt;. Instead of using &lt;a href="http://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/"&gt;Cloudformation&lt;/a&gt;
to spin up an entire stack, I just use a Rakefile to spin up a new &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EC2&lt;/span&gt; instance, test it, and
swap an &lt;a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/elastic-ip-addresses-eip.html"&gt;Elastic &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
if all the tests pass. Of course, this requires that I have relatively complete automated testing
of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EC2&lt;/span&gt; instance. Stock Serverspec can handle 95% of what I want to test, but there are a few
other, more complex, things that it can&amp;#8217;t. So, I wrote some code to fix&amp;nbsp;that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ll admit right off the bat that this code doesn&amp;#8217;t really work the way Serverspec is intended to,
but it works and it&amp;#8217;s relatively simple. This largely breaks the abstraction of serverspec using
&lt;a href="https://github.com/serverspec/specinfra"&gt;specinfra&lt;/a&gt; under the hood, but I&amp;#8217;m not sure if that&amp;#8217;s even
a concern (since specinfra seems to be all about testing a running machine via some local command
execution mechanism, and two of the types that I wrote use network &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IO&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;instead).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the time being, I&amp;#8217;ve written three additional &lt;a href="http://www.rubydoc.info/gems/serverspec-extended-types/#Types"&gt;types&lt;/a&gt;
that solve some specific use cases for&amp;nbsp;me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A &lt;a href="http://www.rubydoc.info/gems/serverspec-extended-types/#bitlbee"&gt;bitlbee&lt;/a&gt;
type that connects to a &lt;a href="http://www.bitlbee.org/"&gt;Bitlbee&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IRC&lt;/span&gt; gateway, authenticates,
and checks the running bitlbee version. It has matchers to check whether or not the connection and
authentication was successful, whether or not it timed out, and the bitlbee version. Parameters for
the type include login nick and password, bitlbee port, and whether or not to connect with&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SSL&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A &lt;a href="http://www.rubydoc.info/gems/serverspec-extended-types/#http_get"&gt;http_get&lt;/a&gt;
type which connects to the system under test (with a specified port) and issues a
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTTP&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GET&lt;/span&gt; request for a specified path, with a specified &lt;code&gt;Host&lt;/code&gt; header and a timeout (default
10 seconds). Matchers are provided for the response content body (string), response headers
(hash), &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTTP&lt;/span&gt; status code, and whether or not the request timed out (which also sets a status of&amp;nbsp;0).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A &lt;a href="http://www.rubydoc.info/gems/serverspec-extended-types/#virtualenv"&gt;virtualenv&lt;/a&gt; type for testing
python &lt;a href="https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/"&gt;virtualenv&lt;/a&gt;s. It takes the absolute path to the venv
on the filesystem, and uses serverspec&amp;#8217;s built-in file and command execution features to ensure that
the path &amp;#8220;looks like&amp;#8221; a virtualenv, and has matchers for the pip and python versions used in the venv
as well as the &lt;code&gt;pip freeze&lt;/code&gt; output as a hash of requirements and their&amp;nbsp;versions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully this will be of use to someone else as well. As I continue using serverspec, I plan on
adding to the&amp;nbsp;types.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code for serverspec-extended-types is on &lt;a href="https://github.com/jantman/serverspec-extended-types/tree/master"&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;
(pull requests and issues welcome) and it&amp;#8217;s packaged and hosted as a &lt;a href="https://rubygems.org/gems/serverspec-extended-types"&gt;ruby gem&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;a href="http://www.rubydoc.info/gems/serverspec-extended-types/0.0.2#Installation"&gt;Installation&lt;/a&gt; and usage is as simple
as adding it to your Gemfile and &lt;a href="http://www.rubydoc.info/gems/serverspec-extended-types/0.0.2#Usage"&gt;spec_helper&lt;/a&gt;
and then using the types and matchers in your&amp;nbsp;specs.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="serverspec"></category><category term="specinfra"></category><category term="testing"></category><category term="beaker"></category><category term="ruby"></category><category term="rspec"></category><category term="gem"></category></entry><entry><title>Project - Storing and Analyzing Apache httpd Logs from Many Hosts</title><link href="https://blog.jasonantman.com/2012/09/project-storing-and-analyzing-apache-httpd-logs-from-many-hosts/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2012-09-06T05:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2012-09-06T05:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>admin</name></author><id>tag:blog.jasonantman.com,2012-09-06:/2012/09/project-storing-and-analyzing-apache-httpd-logs-from-many-hosts/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve recently started casual work on a side-project to collect, store,

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://graylog2.org/"&gt;Graylog2&lt;/a&gt; - a centralized log management
    application with a powerful web interface. Stores logs in
    &lt;a href="http://www.elasticsearch.org/"&gt;ElasticSearch&lt;/a&gt; (which is built on
    Lucene, a Java-based index and search server) and statistics/graphs
    in MongoDB. It does analytics, alerting, monitoring/graphing and
    searching all through a web interface, and accepts log data via
    syslog, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AMQP&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GELF&lt;/span&gt; (its own log format). Java server and Ruby on
    Rails web&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;UI&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://logstash.net/"&gt;Logstash&lt;/a&gt; - another centralized log project
    that stores and indexes logs, with search via a web &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UI&lt;/span&gt;. &amp;#8220;Ship any
    event to anywhere over any protocol.&amp;#8221; Takes many inputs including
    files, syslog, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AMQP&lt;/span&gt;, Flume, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;STOMP&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTTP&lt;/span&gt; and even twitter, performs a
    number of filters including timestamp checks, parsing, dropping,
    joins, etc, and then sends logs back on an output including &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AMQP&lt;/span&gt;,
    Graylog2 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GELF&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;STOMP&lt;/span&gt;, MongoDB, ElasticSearch, syslog, WebSockets and
    to Nagios. One particularly cool feature is its &amp;#8220;file&amp;#8221; input, which
    continuously tails a file and claims to be log rotation safe. Just&amp;nbsp;cool.&lt;/li&gt;

mine, &lt;a href="http://www.php-ems-tools.com"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EMS&lt;/span&gt; Tools&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;#8217;s a web-based
tool for small emergency services organizations, mainly aimed at
volunteer &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EMS&lt;/span&gt;/ambulance providers. The tool handles roster tracking,
scheduling, equipment maintenance and checks, and a bunch of other
administrative tasks. I first started it in 2007 for the &lt;a href="http://www.midlandparkambulance.com"&gt;Midland Park
Ambulance Corps&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;MPAC&lt;/span&gt;), which I
was a volunteer &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EMT&lt;/span&gt; with from 2005 through 2011. I&amp;#8217;ll admit that it&amp;#8217;s a
perfect model of how not to run a software project. The first few
releases are plain awful code. I was keeping the project in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CVS&lt;/span&gt; at the
time, and posted some early releases on
&lt;a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/php-ems-tools/"&gt;sourceforge&lt;/a&gt; and
FreshMeat, now &lt;a href="http://freecode.com/projects/php-ems-tools"&gt;FreeCode&lt;/a&gt;.
Sometime in 2009, I migrated the contents of the trunk of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CVS&lt;/span&gt; module
to a &lt;a href="http://svn.jasonantman.com/php-ems-tools/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SVN&lt;/span&gt; repository&lt;/a&gt;, but
discarded the history. I also setup a MediaWiki-based website for the
project, giving some information and mainly asking for feedback. Around
that time I started working on a new and heavily updated (fixed) version
for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MPAC&lt;/span&gt;, but since it appeared that there was no interest in the
project, and there were many many local customizations and
organization-specific features, I let their codebase diverge from what
was released, and as a result, stopped keeping it in version control.
Until now, when they need to migrate to a new server, and I&amp;#8217;ve also
gotten some outside interest in the&amp;nbsp;project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, as of this morning, I was left with at least four code&amp;nbsp;bases:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the original &lt;a href="http://cvs.jasonantman.com/cgi-bin/viewvc.cgi/cvs/php-ems-tools-trunk/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CVS&lt;/span&gt;
    repository&lt;/a&gt;
    with branches and tags and some history, untouched since&amp;nbsp;2007&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the &lt;a href="http://svn.jasonantman.com/php-ems-tools/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SVN&lt;/span&gt; repository&lt;/a&gt;
    circa 2009, with only 3 commits, all related to the migration from
    &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CVS&lt;/span&gt; to&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SVN&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a &amp;#8220;release&amp;#8221; tarball that at least one outside organization is
    actually&amp;nbsp;using.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the code that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MPAC&lt;/span&gt; is running, which has been largely rewritten
    since 2009, but also contains a lot of organization-specific&amp;nbsp;customizations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a first step, I created a new &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SVN&lt;/span&gt; repository and migrated the
original &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CVS&lt;/span&gt; repo, complete with history, branches, and tags, to it
using &lt;a href="http://cvs2svn.tigris.org/"&gt;cvs2svn&lt;/a&gt;, and then removed write
permissions on the actual module in the repository. This gave me a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SVN&lt;/span&gt;
repository with all of the history of previous so-called releases, with
a trunk matching r1 of the &amp;#8220;current&amp;#8221; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SVN&lt;/span&gt; repository. I then manually
applied patches to trunk/ for the two commits in the current &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SVN&lt;/span&gt;
repository, and set the svn:date revision property to the correct 2009
date for those commits. I also confirmed that the correct tag matches up
to the &amp;#8220;release&amp;#8221; tarball mentioned above. So, I&amp;#8217;m down to a &amp;#8220;current&amp;#8221;
trunk, plus the locally modified code running on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MPAC&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s current server.
My plan of action from this point is as&amp;nbsp;follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Move the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EMS&lt;/span&gt; Tools website from Mediawiki to my local redmine
    installation, and update the news with a link to this&amp;nbsp;post.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Migrate the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SVN&lt;/span&gt; repository, which now contains full history, to Git
    hosted at Github. Add Github integration to&amp;nbsp;Redmine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Update freshmeat, sourceforge, and anywhere else online that knows
    about the&amp;nbsp;project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Working in a git branch, begin converging the code &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MPAC&lt;/span&gt; is currently
    running with the latest (now git) trunk, trying to provide
    configuration options for anything organization specific, and
    testing as I&amp;nbsp;go.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If all works well, I&amp;#8217;ll end up with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MPAC&lt;/span&gt; running the current trunk, just
some different configuration options, and a working, up-to-date release.
The biggest issues are going to be how I handle the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MPAC&lt;/span&gt;-specific
additions and customizations (a lot of stuff hard-coded for our position
titles, plus our very custom call report and telephone-based call-in
software, which is pretty tightly linked with the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EMS&lt;/span&gt; Tools core),
and how I balance abstracting things to be configurable for other users
versus getting this all done in a reasonable amount of&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the impending move to an apartment in Georgia and the migration of
my rack full of servers to a hosting provider, there&amp;#8217;s no longer a need
for me to run my &lt;a href="http://www.vyatta.org/"&gt;Vyatta &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; router on a beefy
dual-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CPU&lt;/span&gt; RAIDed &lt;a href="http://h18000.www1.hp.com/products/quickspecs/11504_na/11504_na.HTML"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DL360&lt;/span&gt;
G3&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;HP&lt;/span&gt; Proliant server chassis. I found an older PCEngines &lt;a href="http://pcengines.ch/alix2c1.htm"&gt;Alix
2c1&lt;/a&gt; single board computer (433 MHz &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AMD&lt;/span&gt;
Geode &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LX700&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class="caps"&gt;128MB&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DDR&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DRAM&lt;/span&gt;, CompactFlash (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CF&lt;/span&gt;) card socket, MiniPCI, 3x
10/100 ethernet) lying around, and decided to turn that into the new
router. But I&amp;#8217;ve been so spoiled by Vyatta&amp;#8217;s good performance (well, at
least on an x86 server) and the &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CLI&lt;/span&gt;, so I don&amp;#8217;t think I can go
back to something like &lt;a href="http://m0n0.ch/wall/"&gt;m0n0wall&lt;/a&gt; or
&lt;a href="http://www.pfsense.org/"&gt;pfSense&lt;/a&gt;, and since it&amp;#8217;s going to be my only
network services box (also doing &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DNS&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DHCP&lt;/span&gt;, firewalling, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NAT&lt;/span&gt;, and maybe
IPsec &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VPN&lt;/span&gt;) it&amp;#8217;s not viable to use the type of older Cisco or Juniper
hardware that I can&amp;nbsp;afford.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The down side is that Vyatta isn&amp;#8217;t really designed or tuned for small
systems, let alone &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CF&lt;/span&gt; media that doesn&amp;#8217;t take too well to lots of
writes. So, I&amp;#8217;m going to begin experimentation with doing a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CF&lt;/span&gt; install
of the current Vyatta Core 6.3, and we&amp;#8217;ll see how it goes and what
tuning I do over&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found two relatively good references; a &lt;a href="http://www.vyatta.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=502"&gt;post on the vyatta.org
forum&lt;/a&gt; from 2008,
relating to Vyatta version 4 (also on the author&amp;#8217;s
&lt;a href="http://dataflip.blogspot.com/2008/06/optimizing-vyatta-for-compact-flash.html"&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;),
and a &lt;a href="http://peytongroup.wordpress.com/2010/02/16/vyatta-community-on-a-compact-flash/"&gt;blog
post&lt;/a&gt;
detailing a more complex
&lt;a href="http://squashfs.sourceforge.net/"&gt;SquashFS&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tmpfs"&gt;tmpfs&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href="http://unionfs.filesystems.org/"&gt;UnionFS&lt;/a&gt;
read-only Vyatta install. Given my relatively short timeframe and little
free time, I decided to try the former approach for now, and plan to
make a more customized and tuned &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CF&lt;/span&gt; version of Vyatta in the&amp;nbsp;future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Creating the actual disk&amp;nbsp;image:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My development platform at the moment is an intel-based MacBook Pro,
running MacOS X 10.6.4 and VirtualBox 4.0.12. As much of a Linux fan as
I am, my work laptop runs Mac (like everyone else in the office) and
lately I can&amp;#8217;t guarantee that I&amp;#8217;ll be at my desktop long enough to
finish anything. The target is an Alix2c1 with a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;2GB&lt;/span&gt; SanDisk Ultra &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CF&lt;/span&gt;
card (yes, I know an industrial card would be better, but I couldn&amp;#8217;t get
my hands on one). For starters, I created a new VirtualBox &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VM&lt;/span&gt; with the
following&amp;nbsp;settings:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;OS&lt;/span&gt; Type: Linux&amp;nbsp;2.6&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Base Memory:&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;128MB&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Boot Order: Floppy, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CD&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ROM&lt;/span&gt;, Hard&amp;nbsp;Disk&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;IDE&lt;/span&gt; Controller Primary: mounted vyatta-livecd_VC6.3 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISO&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;image&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;IDE&lt;/span&gt; Controller Secondary: &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RAW&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VMDK&lt;/span&gt; image (created&amp;nbsp;below)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Audio:&amp;nbsp;None&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Network: Disabled &lt;em&gt;(this is important, as Vyatta saves the
    interfaces by hardware address, and it would require some config
    editing and reboots to change&amp;nbsp;them)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Serial Port: disconnected (but&amp;nbsp;present)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One difficulty I ran into on Mac is mounting the raw &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CF&lt;/span&gt; card in the
VirtualBox guest. I plugged it in via a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USB&lt;/span&gt; reader, and of course it
automatically mounted in MacOS. I ejected it and the &lt;code&gt;/dev/disk1&lt;/code&gt; device
disappeared. It turns out that the full procedure (as far as I could
tell) for Mac&amp;nbsp;is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Plug in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CF&lt;/span&gt; card and&amp;nbsp;reader.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It should automount. Run &lt;code&gt;mount&lt;/code&gt; to see what the actual device is -
    in my case, the &lt;code&gt;/dev/disk1s1&lt;/code&gt; partition was mounted, so the disk is
    &lt;code&gt;/dev/disk1&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run &lt;code&gt;sudo umount -f /dev/disk1&lt;/code&gt;. It seems that the MacOS automounter
    has a god complex, so you may need to re-run this command quite a
    few times throughout the process if you get device or resource busy&amp;nbsp;errors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In an appropriate directory, create the raw &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VMDK&lt;/span&gt; image with:
    &lt;code&gt;VBoxManage internalcommands createrawvmdk -filename rawdisk.vmdk -rawdisk /dev/disk1&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When creating your &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VM&lt;/span&gt;, you&amp;#8217;ll have an option to select Use an
    Existing Virtual Disk. Use that option, and select the file created
    in the last&amp;nbsp;step.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once that&amp;#8217;s done, and you&amp;#8217;ve setup the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VM&lt;/span&gt; with the raw disk, boot the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VM&lt;/span&gt;
(should boot to the Vyatta LiveCD), login as usual for an install
(vyatta:vyatta), and the the fun&amp;nbsp;begins:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At the prompt after logging in, &lt;code&gt;sudo su -&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Edit &lt;code&gt;/opt/vyatta/sbin/install-system&lt;/code&gt; (hint: Vyatta has nano and vi
    installed. &lt;code&gt;nano -c filename&lt;/code&gt; shows line numbers) and change the
    &lt;code&gt;ROOT_FSTYPE&lt;/code&gt; variable (line 78 in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VC6&lt;/span&gt;.3) from &amp;#8220;ext4&amp;#8221; to&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8220;ext2&amp;#8221;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run &lt;code&gt;install-system&lt;/code&gt;. I used all default options (including one
    partition) and it seemed to work fine. It took a minute or two to
    create the ext2 filesystem on my &lt;span class="caps"&gt;2GB&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CF&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;card.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The file copy took even longer&amp;#8230; so be patient, or have a book&amp;nbsp;handy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When system-install finishes and you get the root prompt back,
    before rebooting, continue with some minor&amp;nbsp;tweaks:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;mkdir /mnt/temp&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/temp&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;cd /mnt/temp&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Edit &lt;code&gt;boot/grub/grub.cfg&lt;/code&gt; and change all occurrences of
    &amp;#8220;root=&lt;span class="caps"&gt;UUID&lt;/span&gt;=&amp;#8230;&amp;#8221; entries for the &amp;#8220;linux&amp;#8221; lines (lines 13, 18, 23, 28
    in my grub.cfg) to &amp;#8220;root=/dev/sda1&amp;#8221;. My only real reason for this
    change is so that I can move my altered config files (config.boot,
    fstab and grub.cfg) with minimal changes when I upgrade or make a
    different vyatta &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CF&lt;/span&gt; card, without having to update the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UUID&lt;/span&gt; for the
    new&amp;nbsp;partition.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Edit &lt;code&gt;etc/fstab&lt;/code&gt; and change the &amp;#8220;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;UUID&lt;/span&gt;=&amp;#8230;&amp;#8221; device to&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8221;/dev/sda1&amp;#8221;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;shutdown&lt;/code&gt;. Once the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VM&lt;/span&gt; is stopped, you can remove the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CF&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;card.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The PCEngines Alix.2 boards use a default serial console speed of
    38400 baud. Pretty much every network device, plus Linux and Vyatta,
    use a default speed of 9600 baud. Once I got the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CF&lt;/span&gt; card installed
    in the Alix board and hooked it up to my laptop (null modem cable to
    a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PL&lt;/span&gt;-2303 based &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USB&lt;/span&gt; to serial adapter, minicom for terminal
    emulation), I set my terminal emulator to 38400 8N1, powered the
    board, and then pressed &amp;#8216;s&amp;#8217; during &lt;span class="caps"&gt;POST&lt;/span&gt; to get into &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BIOS&lt;/span&gt; settings.
    Option &amp;#8216;9&amp;#8217; sets the Alix to 9600 baud, &amp;#8216;Q&amp;#8217; to quit, and &amp;#8216;Y&amp;#8217; to save
    changes permanently. The board will reboot, and once the terminal
    emulator is set back to 9600 baud, serial console should work fine
    both in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BIOS&lt;/span&gt; and in the&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;OS&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If all worked well, you should be able to boot into Vyatta and login as
the default &amp;#8220;vyatta&amp;#8221; user (which you set a password for during the
install). Assuming you know your way around Vyatta, it&amp;#8217;s pretty standard
from here, though there are a few things you may want to check or
configure right&amp;nbsp;away:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In configuration mode (&lt;code&gt;configure&lt;/code&gt;) run &lt;code&gt;show interfaces&lt;/code&gt;. All of
    your physical ethernet interfaces should appear, along with their
    &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MAC&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;addresses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some changes to reduce the number of log writes to the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CF&lt;/span&gt; card:
    &lt;code&gt;set system syslog console facility all level notice&lt;/code&gt; and
    &lt;code&gt;set system syslog global facility protocols level notice&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Configure interfaces. with firewalls, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IP&lt;/span&gt; addresses or &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DHCP&lt;/span&gt;,&amp;nbsp;etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do whatever other configuration you need for a minimal system -
    dhcp, dns, nat,&amp;nbsp;etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;#8217;s it - this should give you a working Vyatta system on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CF&lt;/span&gt; on an
Alix board. Stay tuned, hopefully in a month or so I&amp;#8217;ll get around to
customizing it a bit more, based on the second blog entry linked&amp;nbsp;above.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="alix"></category><category term="embedded"></category><category term="network"></category><category term="pcengines"></category><category term="router"></category><category term="vyatta"></category></entry><entry><title>Downtime Last Night; Coping with outages on a shoestring budget</title><link href="https://blog.jasonantman.com/2011/01/downtime-last-night-coping-with-outages-on-a-shoestring-budget/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-01-10T09:22:00-05:00</published><updated>2011-01-10T09:22:00-05:00</updated><author><name>admin</name></author><id>tag:blog.jasonantman.com,2011-01-10:/2011/01/downtime-last-night-coping-with-outages-on-a-shoestring-budget/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Anyone who tried to visit any of my sites last night, or send me email,

probably noticed that I dropped off the face of the earth. I take my
uptime pretty seriously - even with virtually no budget, about 10
minutes of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UPS&lt;/span&gt; time, and everything hosted out of my basement. I&amp;#8217;ve only
had about a &lt;a href="/2010/03/downtime-past-few-days-coping-with-storms/"&gt;6-hour block of
downtime&lt;/a&gt; in the
past 21 months, aside from that nothing externally visible except a few
sub-3-minute hiccups. And the 6 hours was due to a major power outage
that quickly overwhelmed my &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UPS&lt;/span&gt;. Without a generator, I can&amp;#8217;t really
blame anyone for that. Anyway, last night into this morning I had
partial to full outages for about 12 hours. By far the most I&amp;#8217;ve had
since I literally ripped apart my entire infrastructure, moved it from
shelves to a rack, and put it back together on the&amp;nbsp;fly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;d like to apologize to the few people whose web sites or other
services I host out of my house. On one hand, I think those few people
are getting their money&amp;#8217;s worth from their free hosting :) On the other
hand I know how frustrating it can be, especially when you can&amp;#8217;t even
resolve &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DNS&lt;/span&gt; and my email is down. Rest assured that this situation
deeply bothers me, and I&amp;#8217;m already hard at work on plans to at least
keep people (both the people I do hosting for and their visitors)
informed if something like this should happen in the&amp;nbsp;future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The&amp;nbsp;Story:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, yesterday afternoon as I was at my father&amp;#8217;s house about an hour
away, I started to get a slew of &lt;a href="http://www.nagios.org"&gt;Nagios&lt;/a&gt;
notification SMSes (well, email to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SMS&lt;/span&gt;). They started at 14:22 and
stopped after a few minutes, but since I was driving, I didn&amp;#8217;t check
them. When I got home, I found a scenario I hadn&amp;#8217;t really anticipated -
the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TV&lt;/span&gt; worked fine, but I had virtually no connectivity on my cable
Internet line. I got home around 16:22 and had spotty-at-best
connectivity. I could get some &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DNS&lt;/span&gt; in and out, but it was pretty much
impossible to load a web page on my desktop. I was getting Nagios alerts
out in bursts, and the postfix queue was pretty full. A cursory
inspection showed both routers (mine and Optimum&amp;#8217;s) online with link,
the Modem had link and was blinking away, but I was passing &amp;lt; 100 Kbps
of data. My &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DOCSIS&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;MIB&lt;/span&gt; checks on the cable modem were spitting back all
sorts of bad values. Not good. I checked coax connections, rebooted the
modem and router, and went outside to inspect the aerials and the
splitters on the outside of the house. Nothing visibly wrong, and no
positive change after the reboot. Now the modem wasn&amp;#8217;t showing link at
all, and I couldn&amp;#8217;t even ping its &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LAN&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;IP&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I called Optimum at 17:12 and went through the initial troubleshooting
with the technical support guy. I told him I&amp;#8217;d already power-cycled the
modem, and gave him a rundown of the status lights. He confirmed that
they couldn&amp;#8217;t even see the modem on the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WAN&lt;/span&gt; side, and would have to send
a tech out. The big plus to Optimum Business is that, despite it being
after 5 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PM&lt;/span&gt; on a Sunday night, I was given an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ETA&lt;/span&gt; of 2-4 hours. After
about 15 minutes, I power-cycled the modem again, and was able to get
link. I was seeing some data pushed through the routers, but only about
50Kbps. I called Optimum back, spoke with another tech, and was told
that they couldn&amp;#8217;t even get diagnostics back from the modem, and were
seeing 94% packet loss on ping. Time to wait for the&amp;nbsp;tech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The field tech arrived at 17:53. Utterly amazing&amp;#8230; about 30 minutes
after I got off the phone with tech support. I don&amp;#8217;t know if they keep
their better techs waiting around for business customers, but this guy -
Jason - was one of the most knowledgeable and experienced that I&amp;#8217;ve ever
met. He poked around the modem a bit, re-did some of the shoddy work
that the original installers left, and then climbed the pole to figure
out what was going on. About half an hour later, he came back with the
bad news. His test scope wouldn&amp;#8217;t even lock on to the 609MHz carrier
used for the cable modem, so there was something definitely wrong, and
it was past the pole in front of the house. He told me they&amp;#8217;d need to
escalate the problem to the outside plant engineers, but since I was a
business customer, I could expect some update or fix in 6-18 hours. He
left around 18:30. Well, I was bummed, but I used the time to get other
stuff done and start planning for at least minimal &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DR&lt;/span&gt; plans for the&amp;nbsp;future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to my off-site Nagios, I at least got some mail out and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SSH&lt;/span&gt; in
from 19:55 to 20:44, and then had another total loss of connectivity.
Everything came back around 02:20 today, meaning a full 12 hours of&amp;nbsp;downtime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Analysis and Future&amp;nbsp;Plans:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well for the foreseeable future I&amp;#8217;m just working my day job and probably
not doing much (paid) consulting, so purchasing a backup connection is
out of the question - especially since FiOS charges almost twice what
Optimum does for static &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IP&lt;/span&gt; service. There&amp;#8217;s really no way I could&amp;#8217;ve
prevented this outage, and it turns out that the problem wasn&amp;#8217;t even on
my property, so it&amp;#8217;s not anything I could have fixed myself (or
prevented by convincing Optimum to let me purchase a spare modem to keep
on hand). Once again, for something that isn&amp;#8217;t directly money-making for
me, it&amp;#8217;s not really worth it to try and get hosting as a backup, since
I&amp;#8217;ve got all sorts of complex postfix configurations, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BIND&lt;/span&gt; master/slave
replication, etc. Within my budget, I can&amp;#8217;t really say there&amp;#8217;s anything
I could do to solve this problem, or to get even half of my services
back up. My offsite Nagios is behind a dynamic residential cable
connection, so that won&amp;#8217;t really fix any problems&amp;nbsp;either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My plan for the short-term is to find a static &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IP&lt;/span&gt; somewhere that I can
run a box behind, add it as a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NS&lt;/span&gt; record, and at the minimum setup a
caching Postfix server, a catch-all Apache server with a &amp;#8220;we know about
it, we&amp;#8217;re coming back soon&amp;#8221; page, and hacked &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BIND&lt;/span&gt; zone files that point
everything at this one box (albeit with a low&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TTL&lt;/span&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If anyone out there happens to read this, any comments on how to deal
with a total loss of connectivity on a budget of, say, $15/month above
the cost of my Optimum&amp;nbsp;connection??&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="disaster recovery"></category><category term="downtime"></category><category term="failover"></category><category term="redundancy"></category></entry><entry><title>Virtualization Options</title><link href="https://blog.jasonantman.com/2010/03/virtualization-options/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-03-19T20:55:00-04:00</published><updated>2010-03-19T20:55:00-04:00</updated><author><name>admin</name></author><id>tag:blog.jasonantman.com,2010-03-19:/2010/03/virtualization-options/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned in &lt;a href="/2010/03/downtime-past-few-days-coping-with-storms/"&gt;Downtime past few days, coping with

that supports &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HVM&lt;/span&gt; (Intel &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VT&lt;/span&gt;-x or &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AMD&lt;/span&gt;-V ), I immediately decided that I
might as well give up on any thoughts of doing full virtualization or
getting new-ish hardware. So I settled on the next step up from what
have now - a set of &lt;a href="http://h18000.www1.hp.com/products/quickspecs/11504_na/11504_na.HTML"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;HP&lt;/span&gt; Proliant &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DL360&lt;/span&gt;
G3&lt;/a&gt;
servers. I got them with a 90 day warranty from a reputable dealer, dual
2.8GHz Xeon (512K cache), 2Gb &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RAM&lt;/span&gt;, dual 36.4Gb U320 15k &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RPM&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SCSI&lt;/span&gt; disks
and dual power supplies for $99 each. My next step is to decide what
virtualization software to&amp;nbsp;use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My main goals for the project&amp;nbsp;are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lower power consumption through consolidation of&amp;nbsp;servers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Possibility to add capacity or resources by remotely powering up an
    idle server and migrating VMs to&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Limited fault tolerance - ability to manually restore a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VM&lt;/span&gt; that was
    running on failed hardware, onto an idle&amp;nbsp;server.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I originally thought Xen, just out of reflex. However, given that all of
my servers have the same base - the same distribution and, ideally, the
same kernel and patch level - it seemed like a lot of overhead to
duplicate that for multiple VMs. So I started looking into &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system-level_virtualization"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;OS&lt;/span&gt;-level
virtualization&lt;/a&gt;.
There are relatively few options, and I&amp;#8217;ll admit that aside from Solaris
Containers (which I learned about while working at Sun) I don&amp;#8217;t know
much about it. But &lt;a href="http://www.openvz.org/"&gt;OpenVZ&lt;/a&gt; seems to be the
front runner in that area. My initial impression was that it made a lot
of sense - keep one common kernel, but allow containers/virtual
environments (CTs/VEs) to have, essentially, their own userland.
Unfortunately, it doesn&amp;#8217;t seem to be as hyped as Xen, and I haven&amp;#8217;t
heard very much about it in the enterprise context. And it requires
running a kernel from the OpenVZ project, which means I can&amp;#8217;t just
script updates through yum as easily as&amp;nbsp;normal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the up size, OpenVZ would allow me to eliminate the duplication of
the kernel, and seems to have much less overhead than Xen (and logically
so). On the down side, I lose the ability to virtualize other OSes,
kernel versions, or make pre-packaged VMs. I&amp;#8217;ve decided that if I wanted
to do that, I could dedicate a single&amp;nbsp;machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve spent the last day or so doing a lot of research, and have come up
with the following questions and concerns about OpenVZ which I hope to
be able to answer (I&amp;#8217;ll post the answers in a&amp;nbsp;follow-up).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do I handle distribution and kernel upgrades? The logical
    solution would be to migrate the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CT&lt;/span&gt; to another host while I upgrade
    &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CT0&lt;/span&gt; (the hardware &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OS&lt;/span&gt;/host/dom0 in Xen speak). But if the guest and
    host kernels must match, how does this&amp;nbsp;work?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can I do package upgrades within the guest/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CT&lt;/span&gt; easily? WIll this play
    well with&amp;nbsp;Puppet?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How will I handle backups? Is it logical to run
    &lt;a href="http://www.bacula.org"&gt;bacula&lt;/a&gt; within each &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CT&lt;/span&gt;, or just on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CT0&lt;/span&gt;? If
    just on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CT0&lt;/span&gt;, how do I easily verify that a particular &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CT&lt;/span&gt; was backed&amp;nbsp;up?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;WIll everything play well with Puppet? (see&amp;nbsp;below)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Am I willing to throw away my KickStart-based installs? And,
    similarly, am I willing to give up the possibility of migrating from
    a container to a Xen host or a physical host&amp;nbsp;(easily)?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;OpenVZ live migration relies on rsync. This means that there&amp;#8217;s a
    significant delay (compared to shared storage) and also that I can&amp;#8217;t
    migrate off of a host that&amp;#8217;s down. Is there a way around&amp;nbsp;this?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Similarly, live migration requires root &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SSH&lt;/span&gt; key exchange
    (passwordless) between the hosts. This seems about equivalent to
    using &lt;code&gt;hosts.equiv&lt;/code&gt;. Do I really want root on one box to mean root
    on another box (and all of the containers on that&amp;nbsp;box)?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can I still firewall &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CT0&lt;/span&gt;? How will this&amp;nbsp;work?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems to me that OpenVZ may be significantly less enterprise-class
than Xen. Sure, this is just my home setup, but I hold it to the same
standards I use for my work systems. In fact, I usually test new
technologies at home before I suggest them at work. A lot of the writing
on the &lt;a href="http://wiki.openvz.org/"&gt;OpenVZ wiki&lt;/a&gt; seems to be riddled with
spelling errors. They claim &amp;#8220;zero downtime&amp;#8221; live migration, but if they
have to rsync 2Gb of MySQL tables, that sounds like a lot more than
&amp;#8220;zero&amp;#8221;. And, most shockingly, the &lt;a href="http://wiki.openvz.org/Hardware_testing"&gt;Hardware
testing&lt;/a&gt; wiki page talks about
making sure your hosts aren&amp;#8217;t overclocked or undercooled, and running
&lt;code&gt;cpuburn&lt;/code&gt; to test your system under high load. Sorry, but the engineers
at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HP&lt;/span&gt;, Sun, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IBM&lt;/span&gt;, etc. handle that for me and most people I know. So, I&amp;#8217;m
a bit worried about the seriousness of the OpenVZ&amp;nbsp;project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most worrisome is a post I found in the &lt;a href="http://forum.openvz.org"&gt;OpenVZ
forum&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://forum.openvz.org/index.php?t=msg&amp;amp;goto=14818&amp;amp;"&gt;&amp;#8220;Stopping puppet on hn stops it in all
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;VE&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt;. It seems
that, since &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CT0&lt;/span&gt; is aware of all of the guest container processes, they
show up in ps lists. Most, if not all RedHat init scripts use killproc
to stop and restart services. This means that a &lt;code&gt;service syslog stop&lt;/code&gt; on
the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CT0&lt;/span&gt; (host) will stop &lt;strong&gt;all&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;code&gt;syslog&lt;/code&gt; processes, including all of
them in the CTs. This seems like a major issue. Sure, I could replace
&lt;code&gt;killproc&lt;/code&gt; on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CT0&lt;/span&gt; with a script that parses the process list, isolates
the PIDs for those running on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CT0&lt;/span&gt;, and kills them. But what else needs
to be fixed? Nagios check scripts would need to be adjusted. Is there
anything else that would come back and bite&amp;nbsp;me?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bottom line is that (I guess this is logical) it seems that
containers in OpenVZ will seem - and act - a lot less like a logical
host than they would under&amp;nbsp;Xen.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="OpenVZ"></category><category term="virtualization"></category><category term="xen"></category></entry><entry><title>New web server, WP optimization</title><link href="https://blog.jasonantman.com/2010/02/new-web-server-wp-optimization/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-02-28T23:19:00-05:00</published><updated>2010-02-28T23:19:00-05:00</updated><author><name>admin</name></author><id>tag:blog.jasonantman.com,2010-02-28:/2010/02/new-web-server-wp-optimization/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Tonight, more or less on a whim, I moved my blog from my older (dual

&lt;a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/programs/ab.html"&gt;ab&lt;/a&gt; (ApacheBench),
and just moving from one server to the other got some serious
performance gains (I was profiling with runs of 1000 requests total, 10
concurrent requests). I also added the &lt;a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/w3-total-cache/"&gt;W3 Total
Cache&lt;/a&gt; Wordpress
plugin, which got the numbers to look even&amp;nbsp;better!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a side note, this was all done pretty quickly (moving the database
and tarball for the vhost, installing the plugin, changing &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DNS&lt;/span&gt;), so
please give me a heads-up if you experience any&amp;nbsp;problems.&lt;/p&gt;

dual-core Xeons at 2.8 GHz, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;2GB&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RAM&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;16GB&lt;/span&gt; swap, OpenSuSE 11.1 64-bit.
This was on the same &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LAN&lt;/span&gt; and subnet as the servers, with the workstation
connected via a 1Gbps copper Ethernet link and the web-serving
interfaces of the servers connected via 100Mbps (There&amp;#8217;s a trunk in
between, from the gigabit aggregation switch to the 100Mbps distribution&amp;nbsp;switch).&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="apache"></category><category term="optimization"></category><category term="performance"></category><category term="wordpress"></category></entry><entry><title>Project Announcement - PHPsa</title><link href="https://blog.jasonantman.com/2009/09/project-announcement-phpsa/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2009-09-29T15:36:00-04:00</published><updated>2009-09-29T15:36:00-04:00</updated><author><name>admin</name></author><id>tag:blog.jasonantman.com,2009-09-29:/2009/09/project-announcement-phpsa/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;So, here&amp;#8217;s the &amp;#8220;official&amp;#8221; scoop on the new project that I&amp;#8217;m

planning/starting to work on. I&amp;#8217;m calling it PHPsa for now, and it&amp;#8217;s
going to (hopefully) be an integrated dashboard/portal for SysAdmins.
While there are a number of tools that fit into this general category
(perhaps with &lt;a href="http://www.alienvault.com/home.php?section=News"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;OSSIM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
being the closest, though it&amp;#8217;s security-minded), I feel that there&amp;#8217;s a
real gap in terms of tool integration. My daily workflow, which includes
multiple trips to and correlation among Nagios, Cacti, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DNS&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DHCP&lt;/span&gt;,
Puppet, logs, and other tools really leaves something to be desired. So,
I&amp;#8217;m setting out to create a modular SysAdmin dashboard that unifies many
of the common SysAdmin-related tools into a modular&amp;nbsp;dashboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first overall design goals that I&amp;#8217;ve set&amp;nbsp;are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A modular, plugin-based architecture that allows admins to select
    which features/tools they want, and allows easy development of new&amp;nbsp;modules.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Design with legacy tools in mind - easy ways to tie in to tools that
    weren&amp;#8217;t written with PHPsa in mind, both in terms of linking to
    information and gathering/unifying&amp;nbsp;information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;RBAC&lt;/span&gt;, including per-module rules and the possibility for a limited
    read-only view (client/user&amp;nbsp;mode).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use of data sources, specifically web-based/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;REST&lt;/span&gt; APIs where
    available, and databases otherwise, from existing tools with as
    little modification as&amp;nbsp;possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Support for database abstraction, though I&amp;#8217;ll be using&amp;nbsp;MySQL.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eventually, implement &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RSS&lt;/span&gt; feeds of pertinent&amp;nbsp;information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Balance Ajax/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DHTML&lt;/span&gt; with the desire for important things to have
    canonical, static, bookmark-able&amp;nbsp;URLs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, here are some of the things that I&amp;#8217;m planning on integrating, with
obvious bias towards getting my own projects done before I integrate
pre-existing&amp;nbsp;tools:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://multibindadmin.jasonantman.com"&gt;MultiBindAdmin&lt;/a&gt;, my &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DNS&lt;/span&gt; and
    &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DHCP&lt;/span&gt; administration tool (specifically geared towards split-view &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DNS&lt;/span&gt;
    with the inside view behind&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NAT&lt;/span&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://rackman.jasonantman.com/"&gt;RackMan&lt;/a&gt;, my tool for mapping
    devices&amp;#8217; physical locations in racks (and tacking&amp;nbsp;patching).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My simple config tool for
    &lt;a href="http://www.puppetlabs.com"&gt;Puppet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://nagios.org/"&gt;Nagios&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.cacti.net/"&gt;Cacti&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nathan Hubbard&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href="http://www.machdb.org/"&gt;MachDB&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bacula.org/en/"&gt;Bacula&lt;/a&gt; (monitoring/status&amp;nbsp;only).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Syslog via &lt;a href="http://www.rsyslog.com/"&gt;rsyslog&lt;/a&gt; (or any other
    syslog-to-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SQL&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;solution).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Possibly a front-end to &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/"&gt;Google
    Analytics&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some of my custom scripts for graphing SpamAssassin, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DNS&lt;/span&gt; queries,&amp;nbsp;etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some sort of Apache log analysis, like
    &lt;a href="http://www.mrunix.net/webalizer/"&gt;Webalizer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mail log analysis, possibly
    &lt;a href="http://awstats.sourceforge.net/"&gt;AWstats&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, the first big issues that I&amp;#8217;m going to&amp;nbsp;tackle:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;General layout. Specifically, how to handle a more-or-less
    consistent layout while integrating tools that weren&amp;#8217;t designed for
    PHPsa. I&amp;#8217;ll probably end up using iFrames (or even a frameset) for
    tools that don&amp;#8217;t integrate&amp;nbsp;well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to correlate data/objects between different tools (i.e. how to
    display information from Nagios, Cacti, MultiBindAdmin and MachDB
    for a given&amp;nbsp;host?).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do I want to use a templating engine like
    &lt;a href="http://www.smarty.net/"&gt;Smarty&lt;/a&gt; or hand-code all of the&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How will I handle&amp;nbsp;plugins?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How much code do I want to re-write and how much can I use as-is
    from other tools? And, on a related note, how much existing data can
    I access easily from other tools, vs having to use grabber scripts
    that dump data in&amp;nbsp;MySQL?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 2010-02-03&lt;/strong&gt;: I think this may become a semi-official project
for me at $work, which means that I&amp;#8217;ll be able to dedicate quite a bit
more time to it. Unfortunately, it also means that I will, most likely,
have to give up Nathan Hubbard&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href="http://www.machdb.org/"&gt;MachDB&lt;/a&gt; in
favor of &lt;a href="http://www.ocsinventory-ng.org/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;OCS&lt;/span&gt; Inventory &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NG&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a more
mature project that already includes inventory support for Linux,
Windows and&amp;nbsp;Mac.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="bind"></category><category term="cacti"></category><category term="dns"></category><category term="Nagios"></category><category term="PHPsa"></category><category term="Projects"></category><category term="puppet"></category><category term="rsyslog"></category><category term="sysadmin"></category><category term="syslog"></category></entry><entry><title>DNS Move</title><link href="https://blog.jasonantman.com/2009/09/dns-move/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2009-09-17T13:07:00-04:00</published><updated>2009-09-17T13:07:00-04:00</updated><author><name>admin</name></author><id>tag:blog.jasonantman.com,2009-09-17:/2009/09/dns-move/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I finally began moving &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DNS&lt;/span&gt; for my sites from GoDaddy to my own

currently at the same location and on the same &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WAN&lt;/span&gt; connection (heck,
they&amp;#8217;re beind the same router, too), so is all of the rest of my
infrastructure. Migrating jasonantman.com was definitely the most
critical task, this has allowed me to easily use my new project,
&lt;a href="http://multibindadmin.jasonantman.com"&gt;MultiBIND Admin&lt;/a&gt; to manage &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DNS&lt;/span&gt;.
In addition to just being simpler than using GoDaddy&amp;#8217;s tool, it allows
me to manage &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DNS&lt;/span&gt; for both the external view and the NATed internal view
in one tool. I did have a brief mail outage thanks to some incorrect &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MX&lt;/span&gt;
records being served by the slave, and a few other issues with the
caching &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DNS&lt;/span&gt; servers at work not expiring the old records, but all seems
to be well now. It was a relatively smooth transition, though I haven&amp;#8217;t
yet moved over some of my older less used&amp;nbsp;domains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next part of my project, when I move the ambulance corps hosted
services in-house, will be trying to find a decently-priced &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DNS&lt;/span&gt; hosting
company that will just act as a slave, to keep &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DNS&lt;/span&gt; up if my &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WAN&lt;/span&gt;

    have to manually diff the ambulance corps version to the trunk
    version and merge the changes (leaving out anything specific to our
    organization), but I plan on doing it. The next version will also
    include historical tracking of roster information (member
    information, status, positions, committees, etc.) and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LDAP&lt;/span&gt;
    integration for&amp;nbsp;authentication.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PHPsa&lt;/strong&gt; - My new project, tentatively called PHPsa, is an
    integrated dashboard for sysadmins. The idea is to develop a
    plugin-based portal for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SA&lt;/span&gt; tools. Currently, I will be including
    some of my own projects - MultiBindAdmin (a tool to administer &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BIND&lt;/span&gt;
    and DHCPd, specifically geared towards split-view &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DNS&lt;/span&gt; with the
    inside behind &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NAT&lt;/span&gt;) and RackMan (a tool to track and visualize the
    location of devices within racks, including ability to temporarily
    move devices around) - as well as my updates to Nathan Hubbard&amp;#8217;s
    &lt;a href="http://www.machdb.org/"&gt;MachDB&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

Nathan Hubbard&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href="http://www.machdb.org/"&gt;MachDB&lt;/a&gt;. It adds detailed
network interface information, information on expansion slots, and some
extra details for the system and storage. I plan on developing a patch
and contacting Nathan once I get a chance. It also includes a Python
collector script that I&amp;nbsp;developed.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="machdb"></category><category term="php ems tools"></category><category term="PHPsa"></category><category term="Projects"></category><category term="rackman"></category></entry><entry><title>New Projects</title><link href="https://blog.jasonantman.com/2009/07/new-projects/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2009-07-16T14:05:00-04:00</published><updated>2009-07-16T14:05:00-04:00</updated><author><name>admin</name></author><id>tag:blog.jasonantman.com,2009-07-16:/2009/07/new-projects/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;In terms of ongoing projects, I should be updating RackMan sometime

the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NAT&lt;/span&gt; issue, I&amp;#8217;m also writing my own &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BIND&lt;/span&gt; configuration tool,
currently named &lt;a href="http://multibindadmin.jasonantman.com"&gt;MultiBIND
Admin&lt;/a&gt;. In addition to managing
multiple zones in a sane way, it stores all configuration in MySQL.
Among other things, it can store different &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IP&lt;/span&gt; addresses for A records
for the inside and outside views. Zone files can either be pulled by a
script on the name server (push capability is being worked on) or
downloaded (for uploading to a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DNS&lt;/span&gt; hosting provider like&amp;nbsp;GoDaddy).&lt;/p&gt;

give a recap of what&amp;#8217;s going on. I went down to Mount Holly, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NJ&lt;/span&gt;
yestserday morning - about a 2-/12 hour drive each way, and picked up a
41U rack for the basement. Pretty damn heavy, took me two hours to
disassemble it, wrangle it down the stairs, and get it back together.
It&amp;#8217;s an old round-hole rack, which didn&amp;#8217;t seem to matter much until I
found that the tabs of the Dell Rapid Rails are just a bit too big to
fit in it, so neither my rack &lt;span class="caps"&gt;KMM&lt;/span&gt; nor the rails for my mail server will
fit. A bigger problem, though, is that the guy told me it was the
standard &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HP&lt;/span&gt; 29&amp;#8221; deep, and I found it to be 28-1/4&amp;#8221; deep when I started
racking things up. So, though I just spent $200 on rails for old
Proliants, they&amp;#8217;re all about 1/2&amp;#8221; too long to&amp;nbsp;fit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, I also had Cablevision show up to install the new Optimum
Business with 5 static&amp;nbsp;IPs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, last night around 9:00, I started the arduous task of (for the first
time ever) powering down &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ALL&lt;/span&gt; of my machines, moving them to the new
rack, and re-cabling. That took about 2-1/2 hours, after which my intent
was to bring up the new Optimum connection, configure the Vyatta router,
and roll over mail and web. From what I&amp;#8217;d read of the Vyatta docs it
seemed a relatively straightforward task, and being the stubborn jackass
that I am, I decied, &amp;#8220;hey, it&amp;#8217;s my personal site, it&amp;#8217;s low traffic, and
I want it up before I go to sleep. I&amp;#8217;ll roll over &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DNS&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; I bring
everything&amp;nbsp;up.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was a &lt;strong&gt;very bad idea&lt;/strong&gt;. Vyatta isn&amp;#8217;t nearly as
simple as it seems - especially for someone who isn&amp;#8217;t really a network
(or at least router/firewall) guy. When they say Enterprise, they mean
robust. They also mean that week-long bootcamps aren&amp;#8217;t for naught. It
took me about half an hour to figure out that even if no &amp;#8220;firewall&amp;#8221;
ruleset is associated with an interface, it still has an implicit drop
all. And if you only want to firewall what&amp;#8217;s coming in from the outside
world, and let everything out, you need to add explicit allow all rules
to the in and out sides of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LAN&lt;/span&gt; inteface and the out side of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WAN&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To top all this off, I had some serious still-unexplained &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DHCP&lt;/span&gt; problems
on the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LAN&lt;/span&gt;, a serious issue since I just set all my hosts to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DHCP&lt;/span&gt; (which
I&amp;#8217;ll probably undo soon). So, Yesterday was network work from 7:30 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AM&lt;/span&gt; to
3 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AM&lt;/span&gt; today (including driving to pickup the rack). By the time 3 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AM&lt;/span&gt;
rolled around, I was quite unhappy that I decided to roll over &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DNS&lt;/span&gt; in
order to force myself to get things working, as I ended up going back to
FiOS for client access only. Today started around 10 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AM&lt;/span&gt;, and here I am -
6:30 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PM&lt;/span&gt;, and I just got things working partially right. I have mail
working - arguably the most important - for jasonantman.com only, though
I have yet to setup any&amp;nbsp;aliases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the web side, I&amp;#8217;m working to setup name-based vhosts for all of the
subdomains, but for some reason, blog is showing up for everything.
Luckily it works right.

Optimum Business with 30 down/5 up, a block of 5 static IPs, and no
blocked&amp;nbsp;ports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s going to be a crazy weekend. Probably not the best thing the week
before midterms, but oh well. Tomorrow morning I&amp;#8217;m picking up a 42U rack
for home to replace the Sears shelving unit my boxes are currently on.
Cablevision is supposed to be here between 2-5 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PM&lt;/span&gt; to do the install
(yes, they insist that for Business they do the install, even though
it&amp;#8217;s only a 4-foot coax run from the first splitter to the demarc). I&amp;#8217;ve
got &lt;a href="http://www.vyatta.org"&gt;Vyatta&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CE5&lt;/span&gt; Beta installed on a &lt;a href="http://h18000.www1.hp.com/products/quickspecs/11049_na/11049_na.HTML"&gt;Proliant
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DL360G2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
as the new router, ready to go (after some configuration). I&amp;#8217;ll probably
keep FiOS up until I know the new router is working correctly (I&amp;#8217;ll do a
test on my management&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;VLAN&lt;/span&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once Optimum and the new router is up, the fun&amp;nbsp;starts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Forward the appropriate ports on the new router, including 80 (in
    addition to&amp;nbsp;10011).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bring the old router down and make sure the new one is up,
    operational, and forwarding all the right&amp;nbsp;ports.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Update DynDNS to point to the first &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IP&lt;/span&gt;, used as a catch-all for old
    DynDNS&amp;nbsp;links.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Begin assignment of the 5 IPs (everything will be behind &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NAT&lt;/span&gt;) based
    on a list of what hosts need valid reverse &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DNS&lt;/span&gt;, and then adding
    other ports (NATed) as&amp;nbsp;needed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Update &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DNS&lt;/span&gt; for JasonAntman.com and the other&amp;nbsp;domains.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Update Optimum reverse&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DNS&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ensure that everything works as planned, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DNS&lt;/span&gt; is up, ports are
    forwarded, and everything is as before (at least in terms of&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTTP&lt;/span&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DNS&lt;/span&gt; is up, reconfigure Apache to have a vhost handling any
    legacy requests to port 10011 and rewrite them to&amp;nbsp;www.jasonantman.com.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Setup a vhost for &amp;#8216;www&amp;#8217; that takes URLs that used to be
    subdirectories (i.e. www.jasonantman.com/blog) and rewrites them to
    requests for the appropriate subdomain. Simultaneously move
    everything from the default vhost to name-based&amp;nbsp;vhosts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ensure that old jantman.dyndns.org:10011 requests are being
    redirected properly, and requests for subdirectories under the web
    root are going to the right&amp;nbsp;subdomain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check that this all works acceptably with the existing
    blogger-to-wordpress rewrite&amp;nbsp;script.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finally&lt;/strong&gt; start rolling out some of the new services that I had
    waiting for the new&amp;nbsp;connection.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start the arduous process of reconfiguring my mail server, moving
    from Fetchmail from Verizon to an actual mail server, make
    everything work, and make sure my IPs aren&amp;#8217;t&amp;nbsp;blacklisted.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ugh.&lt;/strong&gt; Find anywhere in the entire &amp;#8216;net where my old @verizon.net
    address appeared (especially GoDaddy, DynDNS, other important stuff)
    and change it to the new jasonantman.com&amp;nbsp;address.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Since this is all in my mother&amp;#8217;s basement (there&amp;#8217;s nothing like a
    mother&amp;#8217;s love, especially when it comes to a constant hum emanating
    from the ground level of a house), figure out what to do for her
    when the verizon.net email goes&amp;nbsp;away.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I might have some downtime this weekend, but when things come back
up, I&amp;#8217;ll be done with this DynDNS and Port 10011&amp;nbsp;crap.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="fios"></category><category term="optimum"></category><category term="vyatta"></category></entry><entry><title>Vyatta Initial Impressions</title><link href="https://blog.jasonantman.com/2009/02/vyatta-initial-impressions/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2009-02-26T10:06:00-05:00</published><updated>2009-02-26T10:06:00-05:00</updated><author><name>admin</name></author><id>tag:blog.jasonantman.com,2009-02-26:/2009/02/vyatta-initial-impressions/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m part-way through the major overhaul of my home network (hosting this

blog and everything else jasonantman.com) that I&amp;#8217;ve been planning for
quite some time. The current hardware is&amp;#8230; uh&amp;#8230; currently&amp;#8230; described
on my Hardware
page, but I soon plan on ditching the wiki and moving to a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CMS&lt;/span&gt; for my
entire&amp;nbsp;site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, so far I&amp;#8217;ve decommissioned my aged &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HP&lt;/span&gt; ProCurve 2424M switch
and replaced it with used but less-aged Cisco 2948G from &lt;a href="http://horizondatacom.com/"&gt;Horizon
Datacom&lt;/a&gt; (purchased on Ebay). Quite an
upgrade. In order to handle network backups a little better, I&amp;#8217;m also
adding a Cisco 4912G 12-port Gigabit (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GBIC&lt;/span&gt;) aggregation switch for the
administrative/backup &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VLAN&lt;/span&gt; - though this was purchased via ebay from
&lt;a href="http://stores.ebay.com/RedApe-Technologies"&gt;RedApe Technologies&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PA&lt;/span&gt;.
The switch came with 12 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;1000BASE&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SX&lt;/span&gt; GBICs, and I plan to do a mix of
copper (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;1000BASE&lt;/span&gt;-T) where it&amp;#8217;s already available (onboard NICs) and
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;1000BASE&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SX&lt;/span&gt; where there&amp;#8217;s enough room in the box for a&amp;nbsp;card.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the hardware side, I also have 2 new boxes - a set of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HP&lt;/span&gt; Proliant
&lt;a href="http://h18000.www1.hp.com/products/quickspecs/11049_na/11049_na.HTML"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DL360&lt;/span&gt;
G2&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8216;s
from &lt;a href="http://www.mjsglobal.com/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;MJS&lt;/span&gt; Global&lt;/a&gt;, who I&amp;#8217;ve done business
with before. The prices were great, and though one of them showed up
with a faulty temperature sensor that prevents boot, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MJS&lt;/span&gt; has been
wonderful and is shipping me a replacement motherboard. One of the boxes
will be running &lt;a href="http://www.vyatta.org/"&gt;Vyatta&lt;/a&gt; (vee-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AH&lt;/span&gt;-tha) &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VC5&lt;/span&gt;
router/firewall software, and the other will be a new services box
running internal &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DNS&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DHCP&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NTP&lt;/span&gt;, and whatever&amp;nbsp;else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the hardware side, I&amp;#8217;m also planning some extended downtime a few
weekends from now, when I should finally have a 42U rack to replace the
Sears shelves my equipment is now on. It&amp;#8217;ll be a fun-filled evening of
racking equipment and re-patching everything. Also, hopefully within a
few weeks, I&amp;#8217;ll be moving my &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WAN&lt;/span&gt; pipe from Verizon FiOS residential to
Optimum Business, which is essentially re-packaged residential but
provides 5 static IPs, no blocked ports, and 30 Mbps down/5 Mbps&amp;nbsp;up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vyatta&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When planning this upgrade, I think I looked at every open source router
package out there, as well as some of the lower-end or older Cisco
models. I&amp;#8217;m currently running &lt;a href="http://www.ipcop.org/"&gt;IPcop&lt;/a&gt;, which does
everything I need except it doesn&amp;#8217;t handle multiple &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WAN&lt;/span&gt; IPs, and all
configuration is via a web interface - which means every time I want to
make a change remotely (and during the week I&amp;#8217;m not home) I have to
forward &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTTPS&lt;/span&gt; over &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SSH&lt;/span&gt;. After doing an extensive feature comparison, I
ended up narrowing it down to a relative newcomer - Vyatta. Though I
don&amp;#8217;t know how much of it is marketing hype, they are targeted squarely
at Cisco, and provide relatively enterprise-level features; a
JunOS-based &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CLI&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BGP&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OSPF&lt;/span&gt;, and all of the other important&amp;nbsp;stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I attempted an install of Vyatta &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CE&lt;/span&gt; 5 Beta on one of the
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DL360G2&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s. The only real problem that I found was the install script
doesn&amp;#8217;t support &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CCISS&lt;/span&gt; drives, as found in the Proliants, but a few
manual hacks to the script fixed that. By far the best thing about
Vyatta is it&amp;#8217;s based on vanilla Debian Lenny, and full root shell access
is available, so modifying the install script - or even adding
non-Vyatta packages - is a cinch. I haven&amp;#8217;t really played around with it
too much, but it appears to be a wonderful mix of Linux and an
enterprise router &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CLI&lt;/span&gt;. While root has a full &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BASH&lt;/span&gt; shell, and the Vyata
commands are all done as shell aliases (so users still have access to
shell primitives and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OS&lt;/span&gt; commands), configuration is accomplished via a
JunOS-like command set. You still get &amp;#8220;commit&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;rollback&amp;#8221; in config
mode, and can still do fun things like save and load configs to/from
tftp, ftp and &lt;em&gt;http&lt;/em&gt;. On the other hand, I doubt I&amp;#8217;ll do config backups
that way since I can just use scp or&amp;nbsp;sftp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Vyatta box will probably go home this weekend, and get hooked up to
the network for config-only use (and I can always get in via iLO on the
hardware) and hopefully come up sometime in the next few&amp;nbsp;weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, the most daunting task is figuring out how to get all of
the existing links to my site to work - since jantman.dyndns.org will be
legacy, and most of the site structure will probably change to use
name-based vhosts. Lately I&amp;#8217;ve been trying to use the real subdomains in
all of my public links, so the transition (planned for a while) will
work, but I&amp;#8217;m sure there are still plenty of links out there that will
need dealing with (maybe keep port 10011 serving &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTTP&lt;/span&gt; with a massive
mod_rewrite script to redirect to the right place???), as well as
checking everything on the web server to make sure there aren&amp;#8217;t any
absolute URLs (like&amp;nbsp;WordPress).&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="cisco"></category><category term="networking"></category><category term="router"></category><category term="vyatta"></category></entry><entry><title>Wordpress Installation, Finished</title><link href="https://blog.jasonantman.com/2009/02/wordpress-installation-finished/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2009-02-03T10:13:00-05:00</published><updated>2009-02-03T10:13:00-05:00</updated><author><name>admin</name></author><id>tag:blog.jasonantman.com,2009-02-03:/2009/02/wordpress-installation-finished/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Found this from a month and a half ago, waiting as a&amp;nbsp;draft:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I mostly finished the WordPress installation. I got everything for
WordPress up and running, tested my Blogger &lt;span class="caps"&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt; redirection script and
then switched over my subdomain&amp;nbsp;redirection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blogger redirection takes two parts, but is in fact quite simple.
First, I went into the directory where the Blogger content had lived -
&lt;code&gt;/srv/www/htdocs/blog&lt;/code&gt; and moved everything in there into another
directory, out of the way. I then created a .htaccess in the directory&amp;nbsp;like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;IfModule&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;mod_rewrite.c&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;RewriteEngine&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;On&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;RewriteBase&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="sx"&gt;/blog/&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;RewriteCond&lt;/span&gt; %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;RewriteCond&lt;/span&gt; %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;RewriteRule&lt;/span&gt; .* index.php [L]
&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/IfModule&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;All this does is used mod_rewrite to serve blog/index.php up for every
page request. In index.php, I handle the important &lt;span class="caps"&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt; forms for Blogger
- archives, tags, feeds, and posts - and redirect to the appropriate
place. For archives, I just parse out the year and month from the
Blogger &lt;span class="caps"&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt; and redirect to the proper page for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WP&lt;/span&gt;. The feed is straight
redirection. The tags (&amp;#8220;labels&amp;#8221; in Blogger parlance) are pulled out of
the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt;, have spaces (after &lt;code&gt;urldecode()&lt;/code&gt;) replaced with dashes and are
redirected to the right tag for&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;WP&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The posts, on the other hand, were a bit more difficult. My solution
ended up being parsing the post name out of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt;. When I used the
import tool, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WP&lt;/span&gt; kept the original Blogger URLs in the &lt;code&gt;wp_postmeta&lt;/code&gt;
table with a &lt;code&gt;meta_key&lt;/code&gt; of &amp;#8220;blogger_permalink&amp;#8221;. I just looked for a
Blogger permalink matching the title from the Blogger &lt;span class="caps"&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt;, found the
corresponding post &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ID&lt;/span&gt; and redirected to the proper new &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WP&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$fail&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;// redirect to the post or month&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Header&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTTP&lt;/span&gt;/1.1 301 Moved Permanently&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nx"&gt;Header&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Location: &amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$redirect_to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="cp"&gt;?&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="x"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;So, it now looks like I&amp;#8217;m pretty much done with setup, and even get to
keep my links. The one interesting problem that will crop up is due to
the fact that, at the moment, I&amp;#8217;m hosting off of a dynamically IPed
residential internet connection, so I&amp;#8217;m at
&lt;code&gt;http://jantman.dyndns.org:10011&lt;/code&gt;. The problem lies in the fact that
Blogger used this for its&amp;#8217; URIs and Permalinks, and it seems that
(though &lt;code&gt;http://blog.jasonantman.com&lt;/code&gt; uses a 302 not a 301 to redirect)
Google, Technorati, etc. have indexed my site with this hostname and
port, instead of the redirecting subdomain. Normally this wouldn&amp;#8217;t be a
problem, but I plan on soon moving to a business hosting account with 5
static IPs and port 80 open. Which means that soon the subdomain will
become &amp;#8220;real&amp;#8221;&amp;#8230; and all of those pesky dyndns.org:10011 links will be
obsolete. The only way I can think of fixing this is, once I make the
switch to static &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IP&lt;/span&gt; and port 80 (which will also include moving all of
my subdomains to name-based virtual hosts) I&amp;#8217;ll have to craft
RewriteRules or redirect rules to replace
&lt;code&gt;http://jantman.dyndns.org:10011/wp/&lt;/code&gt; with
&lt;code&gt;http://blog.jasonantman.com/&lt;/code&gt;, update DynDNS with my new static &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IP&lt;/span&gt;, and
keep a default vhost listening on 10011 to provide rule-based
redirection to the new subdomain.&amp;nbsp;Eek.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="apache"></category><category term="blogger"></category><category term="dynamic IP"></category><category term="wordpress"></category></entry><entry><title>WordPress… Finally!</title><link href="https://blog.jasonantman.com/2008/12/wordpress-finally/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2008-12-17T15:58:00-05:00</published><updated>2008-12-17T15:58:00-05:00</updated><author><name>admin</name></author><id>tag:blog.jasonantman.com,2008-12-17:/2008/12/wordpress-finally/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Well, I finally bit the bullet.

(slow day) and said to myself, &amp;#8220;My blog&amp;#8217;s finally moving to WordPress.
Today.&amp;#8221; So, I read through the docs (really psyched about the Blogger
import feature), downloaded 2.7 (latest), setup the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DB&lt;/span&gt; and installed
away. Once I did the preliminary things like changing the admin password
and setting up some categories, I set about importing from&amp;nbsp;Blogger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here was the first of the major issues. Though WordPress has really
hyped their Blogger importer, they failed to mention that it is totally
useless if you are self-hosting Blogger and publishing via &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FTP&lt;/span&gt; or &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SFTP&lt;/span&gt;,
as I was. So, after a lengthy consultation with the great oracle of
Google, I dedided I had two options - switch Blogger to publish to
BlogSpot.com and use the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WP&lt;/span&gt; import tool, or custom hack a script. I must
admit, it felt a bit pointless&amp;#8230; all of my old posts were in a directry
at the same level as &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WP&lt;/span&gt;, it seemed quite stupid to have to jump through
hoops to get that data. Though I&amp;#8217;m not quite sure whether the GData &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt;
really doesn&amp;#8217;t give access to posts if&amp;nbsp;self-hosted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I migrated publishing of Blogger to BlogSpot.com
(&lt;a href="http://www.jasonantman.com/jargon/entry.php?id=metasyntactic-variable"&gt;foobarthudgrunt&lt;/a&gt;.blogspot.com),
despite worries about confusing Google or messing up the little bit of
ranking I&amp;#8217;ve been able to gain. It successfully imported all 128 of my
entries, and the few comments. But, as I navigated to the &amp;#8220;Edit&amp;#8221; page to
have a look, an even bigger problem was apparent. All of the tags from
Blogger had ended up as categories in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WP&lt;/span&gt;. So I had no tags for any of my
posts, and a gazillion categories with only one post in them. Luckily,
the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DB&lt;/span&gt; schema is pretty sane, and I qickly figured out that both
categories and tags are stored in the &lt;code&gt;wp_term_taxonomy&lt;/code&gt; table, and the
difference between a category and a tag is simply that the &lt;code&gt;taxonomy&lt;/code&gt;
field is either &amp;#8220;category&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;post_tag&amp;#8221;, respectively. So, since I
hadn&amp;#8217;t added any posts in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WP&lt;/span&gt; yet, I just changed &lt;code&gt;taxonomy&lt;/code&gt; to
&amp;#8220;post_tag&amp;#8221; for anything with an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ID&lt;/span&gt; past the categories I&amp;#8217;d added. And
it seems to have worked&amp;nbsp;beautifully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Up next, however, was the hard part: sitting down with my list of
categories and sifting through 128 posts to categorize them. The biggest
pain is the default edit posts table in the admin interface lists 15
posts per page, and with a cursory glance at the source I couldn&amp;#8217;t for
the life of me figure out where that limit is&amp;nbsp;set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next up, I spent some time looking over the configuration options in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WP&lt;/span&gt;,
updating my About page, and listing things to do in the future (more
static pages, blogroll and links,&amp;nbsp;etc.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was finally ready to setup pretty URLs. And&amp;#8230; sure enough&amp;#8230; I
clicked &amp;#8220;submit&amp;#8221; to apply some changes to the default blog &lt;span class="caps"&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt; (my real
domain, as opposed to the DynDNS domain) and subtitle, and I got kicked
out of the admin interface. Try as I might, I had no luck logging in. I
then found that WordPress doesn&amp;#8217;t log anything anywhere - no MySQL log
and no error messages in the Apache error log. Wondeful. I spent about
an hour looking through the source, figuring out how the auth method
works, and trying to set an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MD5&lt;/span&gt; password. It was obviously apparent that
the password in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DB&lt;/span&gt; for my one user (administrative user) was
generated by PHPass, not &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MD5&lt;/span&gt;, but the auth function was evaluating
anything &gt;= 32 characters as PHPass, and the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MD5&lt;/span&gt; of my password was 32
characters, so that wouldn&amp;#8217;t work. I tried the &amp;#8220;forgot password&amp;#8221; link
with both username and email, but no mail was being sent. When I reached
the 2-1/2 hour mark, I started instrumenting the login code with some
&lt;code&gt;error_log()&lt;/code&gt; lines to see what was up. I narrowed the problem down to
the block of code starting at lin 48 in &lt;code&gt;wp-include/user.php&lt;/code&gt; -
specifically, according to the comments, no credentials were being
passed but the cookie wasn&amp;#8217;t set. And it&amp;#8217;s silent in that case. So, at
this point, I&amp;#8217;m totally lost. I decided to clear all of my browser&amp;#8217;s
cookies and auth info, and try again. No dice. After nearly 3 hours, I
decided to do a packet capture, and found the horribly simple reason.
Somewhere in the code, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WP&lt;/span&gt; is evaluating the &amp;#8220;siteurl&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;home&amp;#8221; values
from wp_options, and using them instead of just doing relative links.
As a result, when the form submits, Apache keeps returning a 302, and
the form submission never makes it there. Hopefully this won&amp;#8217;t create a
problem when I transition from DynDNS to a real static &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IP&lt;/span&gt; and domain&amp;nbsp;name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next I enabled pretty permalinks, enabled mod_rewrite in the vhost, and
selected a new template for my blog (though I&amp;#8217;m planning on doing some
heavy customization). I didn&amp;#8217;t want to leave the default template up for
too long, in case Google&amp;#8217;s heavy crawling of my site picked up all of
the new content somehow&amp;#8230; I ended up narrowing it down to three themes,
coincidentally all designed by
&lt;a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/profile/mg12"&gt;mg12&lt;/a&gt;:
&lt;a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/blocks2"&gt;Blocks2&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/inove#post-668"&gt;iNove&lt;/a&gt; or
&lt;a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/elegant-box"&gt;ElegantBox&lt;/a&gt;. I
installed them all on my box and looked at iNove first, and it was love
at first&amp;nbsp;sight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, that&amp;#8217;s where it stands right now. I finally have my blog on
WordPress and running, and have a theme. The action plan for tonight&amp;nbsp;includes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using RewriteRule and a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt; script to point all of the old Blogger
    URLs to the new WordPress&amp;nbsp;installation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adding some new static content, and top-bar links to my other&amp;nbsp;sites.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Refining the theme a bit,&amp;nbsp;possibly?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adding links to my sites, and to the&amp;nbsp;blogroll.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adding the buttons/plugins for del.icio.us, Digg, Slashdot, reddit,&amp;nbsp;etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Redirecting my main blog page to&amp;nbsp;WordPress.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Redirecting or linking my old feed locations to&amp;nbsp;WordPress.&lt;/li&gt;

long long story, which I posted as a Note on&amp;nbsp;facebook.&lt;/p&gt;

revision, and hopefully this will include, among other things, the
following new&amp;nbsp;features:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Support for &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I18n"&gt;i18n&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Some vastly more efficient changes to the database schema,
    specifically dealing with&amp;nbsp;scheduling.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m still working on some other big projects, namely the migration of
this blog to &lt;a href="http://wordpress.org/"&gt;WordPress&lt;/a&gt;, the migration of
&lt;a href="http://www.jasonantman.com"&gt;JasonAntman.com&lt;/a&gt; to some real &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CMS&lt;/span&gt; (Joomla,
Drupal, etc.), and migration of my home internet connection from
residential FiOS to &amp;#8220;business-grade&amp;#8221; Optimum Online (cable) - which will
probably see a slight decrease in reliability from the amazing levels of
FiOS, but will give me five static IPs and no ports&amp;nbsp;blocked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, there&amp;#8217;s been a wrench thrown into all of my plans for
big projects (not even mentioning the projects that have been cast aside
- &lt;a href="http://www.tuctruck.org"&gt;TuxTruck&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href="http://jantman.dyndns.org:10011/tuxostat/"&gt;tuxOstat&lt;/a&gt; which is now down,
and a bunch of others. That wrench is the &lt;a href="http://www.t-mobileg1.com/"&gt;T-Mobile
G1&lt;/a&gt;, the GooglePhone finally come to
fruition. I was psyched about Android when I first heard about it, and
the idea of finally having a phone that I can develop for without
learning a new language sounds amazing. I&amp;#8217;ll admit that at $180 with a
2-year contract, plus $80/month for service (split about 50/50 between
the voice plan and the unlimited data plan) it doesn&amp;#8217;t make the best
financial sense for someone whose car was stolen and now has 2 vehicles
- only one of which I can afford - but I&amp;#8217;m really excited. I&amp;#8217;ve heard
some not-so-good things about the quality of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPS&lt;/span&gt;, and some of the
apps currently available, but within a few months, I&amp;#8217;d assume that the
effects of open development will cause it to greatly surpass the
functionality of my current Treo 700p, running my beloved Palm &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OS&lt;/span&gt; (which
I&amp;#8217;ve been dedicated to for the better part of seven&amp;nbsp;years).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the all-around flexibility of Android and its&amp;#8217; apps is definitely
one of the biggest selling points, my own interest is mainly in the
ability to quickly develop Java apps that bring my already-existing
web-based forms and data to the desktop of my phone. It&amp;#8217;s the simplicity
that is my biggest interest - even for simple purposes, like converting
the web-based fuel log I keep for my car(s) to a dedicated Java-based
form on my&amp;nbsp;phone.&lt;/p&gt;

Not to mention, it doesn&amp;#8217;t allow any of the stuff that I really want,
such as multiple categories with per-category &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RSS&lt;/span&gt;, or good searching. It
also means that, though this blog is hosted on my own server, I&amp;#8217;m
dependent on Blogger to add&amp;nbsp;posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m still horribly busy dealing with insurance companies and the police

figure out what my next vehicle will be, and how much I can spend on&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I&amp;#8217;ve decided that at some point in the future, I&amp;#8217;ll be migrating
to &lt;a href="http://www.wordpress.org"&gt;WordPress&lt;/a&gt; for the blog. It will, of
course, be hosted on my own machine, and will hopefully also include a
migration of everything from this Blogger account. And, somehow, will
include some sort of redirection from old posts to the relevant new
ones. Most importantly, though, I plan on deferring the project until I
get my multiple static &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IP&lt;/span&gt; service from &lt;a href="http://www.optimum.com"&gt;Optimum
Online&lt;/a&gt;, as the new blog (and the rest of my
subdomains) will be moved from GoDaddy forwarding to their own
subdomains setup as Apache name-based&amp;nbsp;VHosts.&lt;/p&gt;

decided to allocate some of the money to hardware upgrades of my
personal machines. While &lt;a href="http://www.nagios.org"&gt;Nagios&lt;/a&gt; gives me a good
idea of where performance is a problem, I&amp;#8217;m still running a large amount
of &amp;#8220;legacy&amp;#8221; hardware (my home router/firewall is a 350MHz P-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;II&lt;/span&gt; desktop)
and hardware age is a significant factor in my upgrade&amp;nbsp;plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I set out looking for a program (most likely some backend scripts
that dump data to MySQL, and then a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt; front-end) to perform a hardware
inventory - essentially, run a script on each box, find out the system
details, and dump it in a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DB&lt;/span&gt;. Now that my pool of upgrade candidates is
above a dozen machines, at multiple locations, some of which are
single-use boxes often neglected/forgotten, doing this in my head isn&amp;#8217;t
the&amp;nbsp;easiest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, while I&amp;#8217;ve been googling and searching some mailing list archives,
I&amp;#8217;m also developing a set of&amp;nbsp;requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chief&amp;nbsp;requirements:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to run a script on a remote machine and have the results
    returned in a meaningful format. Most likely, a single script, run
    as root (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SUID&lt;/span&gt; or sudo) that returns nice, formatted, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SQL&lt;/span&gt;-ready
    results (so the parsing of platform-specific command output will
    happen on the client, with every client returning a normalized data&amp;nbsp;set).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to track hardware changes - i.e. disks swapped from one box
    to another, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NIC&lt;/span&gt; replacement, processor upgrade,&amp;nbsp;etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Each piece of hardware tracked individually, allowing future support
    of fully tracking components, spares,&amp;nbsp;etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Support for future barcoding of components and physically-performed&amp;nbsp;inventory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the data that I&amp;#8217;d like&amp;nbsp;collected:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data on a machine stored by chassis vendor name and serial
    numer/service&amp;nbsp;tag.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hostname associated with each&amp;nbsp;box.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Architecture, number of CPUs/cores and type, model, speed, socket
    (for upgrade&amp;nbsp;planning/ordering).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Motherboard model/manufacturer, serial number, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HW&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SW&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;FW&lt;/span&gt;
    revisions, manufacture&amp;nbsp;date.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Storage (internal &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; directly connected external) - type, interface,
    capacity, specifications/manufacturer and&amp;nbsp;model.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Amount fo &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RAM&lt;/span&gt;, type of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RAM&lt;/span&gt;, and configuration of cards (number of
    empty&amp;nbsp;slots).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PCI&lt;/span&gt; card configuration - number and type/mfr/model of cards, as well
    as number of empty&amp;nbsp;slots&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For all NICs - &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MAC&lt;/span&gt; addresses, current IPs, as well as link
    type/speed and connected&amp;nbsp;switch/port.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;d also like some level of software inventory, especially for those
machines that may be running &amp;#8220;forgotten&amp;#8221;&amp;nbsp;services:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://nmap.org/"&gt;nmap&lt;/a&gt; scan&amp;nbsp;results.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;OS&lt;/span&gt;-generated list of running services, with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GUI&lt;/span&gt; including a
    blacklist of &amp;#8220;default&amp;#8221; services not to be displayed, and possibly
    also cross-links to Nagios&amp;nbsp;status.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Possibly a parsed output from ps, using a blacklist as shown&amp;nbsp;above.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If a firewall is running on the system, a list of all open&amp;nbsp;ports.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ll be checking out some options today. Unfortunately, I have a feeling
that there&amp;#8217;s most likely nothing that supports my requirements, and I&amp;#8217;ll
probably end up implementing a lot of this&amp;nbsp;myself.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="configuration"></category><category term="inventory"></category></entry><entry><title>Possible Downtime this weekend</title><link href="https://blog.jasonantman.com/2008/09/possible-downtime-this-weekend/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2008-09-04T23:03:00-04:00</published><updated>2008-09-04T23:03:00-04:00</updated><author><name>admin</name></author><id>tag:blog.jasonantman.com,2008-09-04:/2008/09/possible-downtime-this-weekend/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Tropical Storm &lt;a href="http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/#HANNA"&gt;Hanna&lt;/a&gt; is expected to

&lt;li&gt;Planning to totally re-wire all networking at the &lt;a href="http://www.midlandparkambulance.com"&gt;ambulance corps
    building&lt;/a&gt; to eliminate some
    problems. This includes &lt;em&gt;building&lt;/em&gt; an 8U wall-mount rack, and also
    trying a &lt;a href="http://www.pcengines.ch/alix2c1.htm"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PC&lt;/span&gt; Engines &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ALIX&lt;/span&gt;.2c1&lt;/a&gt;
    board as a router (still undecided on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WAN&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;LAN&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DMZ&lt;/span&gt; or &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WAN&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;LAN&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;WLAN&lt;/span&gt;).
    It also means a long day of work at some point in the future, and
    lots of cable&amp;nbsp;drops.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://tuxostat.jasonantman.com"&gt;tuxOstat&lt;/a&gt;, the linux-controlled
    thermostat, is pretty much on the back burner. It&amp;#8217;s a stable beta
    with severely reduced functionality, but has been handling my
    cooling needs without any major bugs in the past month or so. It
    still only has a basic &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CLI&lt;/span&gt; interface and a very simple kludge of a
    web &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GUI&lt;/span&gt;, but it works. Other modes (heating, fan only), predictive
    temperature calculation, other temperature/zone calculation modes,
    and physical controls (buttons, menu on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LCD&lt;/span&gt;) are still to come, as
    well as the move from &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PC&lt;/span&gt; to Soekris (if I can ever figure it out,
    and get one with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USB&lt;/span&gt;). I now feel that an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ALIX&lt;/span&gt; board might be a
    better shot, as they take &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CF&lt;/span&gt; (more space than the Soekris), have a
    slightly faster processor, and also support &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USB&lt;/span&gt; at about half the
    price&amp;nbsp;point.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;#8217;m considering moving my main web site to a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CMS&lt;/span&gt;, and letting the
    &lt;a href="http://www.jasonantman.com/wiki/"&gt;wiki&lt;/a&gt; serve more as a knowledge&amp;nbsp;base.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;#8217;m working on patching together a new access point for the
    ambulance corps, based on &lt;a href="http://pyramid.metrix.net/"&gt;Pyramid
    Linux&lt;/a&gt;. I needed something which would
    run on the Soekris net4526, had at least &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WEP&lt;/span&gt;, and supported some
    sort of captive portal. Pyramid has
    &lt;a href="http://dev.wifidog.org/"&gt;WifiDog&lt;/a&gt;, but that only wants to do local
    authentication or &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RADIUS&lt;/span&gt;, and I wanted direct auth to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LDAP&lt;/span&gt; and MySQL
    logging. On the positive side, it just uses some &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt; pages hosted
    under Apache to handle authentication - the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WAP&lt;/span&gt; redirects the user
    to a login page on a (separate) web server, the user does their
    stuff, and then the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WAP&lt;/span&gt; makes a request to the server to determine
    whether it should open up the firewall, keep the user locked down,
    or totally kick them. So, once I figure out some routing issues,
    I&amp;#8217;ll get back to working on the new project -
    &lt;a href="http://blacklabauth.jasonantman.com/"&gt;BlackLabAuth&lt;/a&gt;, a re-write of
    the WifiDog auth server software that&amp;#8217;s geared towards a
    closed-access network (i.e. only people and/or MACs already listed
    in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LDAP&lt;/span&gt; can login) with full logging to MySQL. I already have some
    code &lt;a href="http://cvs.jasonantman.com/BlackLabAuth"&gt;in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CVS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but some
    issues with my development Soekris board have slowed the project for
    the time being. When finished, I&amp;#8217;ll have not only the new auth
    server available for download (with documentation) but also a
    ready-to-run (well, some configuration time needed, but minor and
    scripted) image for the&amp;nbsp;net4526.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My desktop that I use for &lt;a href="http://www.mythtv.org/"&gt;MythTV&lt;/a&gt; filled up
    its&amp;#8217; disk. Totally. I ordered a cheap Syba &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SATA&lt;/span&gt; card (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PCI&lt;/span&gt;) from
    NewEgg, along with a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;500GB&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WD&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SATA&lt;/span&gt;-150 disk, but no luck. Though the
    card (Syba / Initio 1622 chipset, shows up as Class 0106: 1101:1622
    (rev 02)) said it was supported under Linux, the driver &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CD&lt;/span&gt; mentioned
    nothing about it. Some investigation on the Syba website turned up a
    zipped archive. After extraction, I found a readme that gave (poor)
    instructions on how to re-compile a kernel, and warned that you &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MUST&lt;/span&gt;
    have 2.6.15. Oh well, I wasn&amp;#8217;t going to give up 2.6.16.27 (the
    newest &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RPM&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;d kernel for OpenSuSE 10.1). The standard drivers for it
    didn&amp;#8217;t appear until 2.6.25 or so. So&amp;#8230; after many debates with
    myself as to whether I should blow away my whole MythTV installation
    and upgrade from the now-ancient 10.1, I decided that I&amp;#8217;ll only be
    in my apartment for another year, I should make it last. Some
    investigation turned up a $24 Silicon Image-based card that should
    work fine, and it&amp;#8217;s now in the&amp;nbsp;mail&amp;#8230;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m sure I missed something big, but I&amp;#8217;ll update as needed, and attempt
to make it a daily habit to post something interesting or, at the very
least, hard-to-find. After all, I&amp;#8217;m sure that I use this blog and my

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In follow-ups and&amp;nbsp;news:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://tuxostat.jasonantman.com"&gt;tuxostat&lt;/a&gt; has been running for
    nearly a month in my apartment, and appears stable, albeit missing
    many planned features, and with a sub-optimal interface (and no &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SNMP&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;yet).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.tuxtruck.org"&gt;TuxTruck&lt;/a&gt; is still on the back&amp;nbsp;burner.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve been playing around with the idea of writing a new electronic
    patient care report system for the ambulance corps, to replace our
    current three-year-old system (written in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VB&lt;/span&gt; .&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NET&lt;/span&gt; and running on
    Windows). It would probably be coded in Python, with a
    wxWindows/&lt;a href="http://www.wxpython.org/"&gt;wxPython&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GUI&lt;/span&gt;. I&amp;#8217;ll start on a
    small demo version, but would like it to be fully modular, and
    eventually form a codebase for &lt;a href="http://www.openepcr.org"&gt;OpenEPCR&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I&amp;#8217;ve been doing a lot of work for my Building Data-Driven
Websites class (well, alternate assignments, but still a lot of work).
The latest project was an Ajax/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DHTML&lt;/span&gt; calendar. Needless to say, this involved a lot of JavaScript work. To
make it worse, I used a fair amount of sample code to get an idea of how
to do things, and way too many of the snippets out there on the &amp;#8216;net are
in formats that are quite unfriendly for pasting into an Emacs console&amp;nbsp;window.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I happened to come by &lt;a href="http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/"&gt;Steve Yegge&amp;#8217;s
blog&lt;/a&gt;, with a posting on &lt;a href="http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2008/03/js2-mode-new-javascript-mode-for-emacs.html"&gt;his
JavaScript mode for
Emacs&lt;/a&gt;.
Not only does it seem cool, but it was also the only one I could find
that does syntax highlighting and sane indentation (important for copied
code snippets). So, I grabbed it from &lt;a href="http://code.google.com/p/js2-mode/"&gt;Google
Code&lt;/a&gt; and -&amp;nbsp;viola!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="ajax"></category><category term="call report"></category><category term="dhtml"></category><category term="javascript"></category><category term="pcr"></category><category term="tuxostat"></category><category term="tuxtruck"></category></entry><entry><title>Custom MediaWiki Sidebar; New Blog?</title><link href="https://blog.jasonantman.com/2008/06/custom-mediawiki-sidebar-new-blog/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2008-06-18T22:26:00-04:00</published><updated>2008-06-18T22:26:00-04:00</updated><author><name>admin</name></author><id>tag:blog.jasonantman.com,2008-06-18:/2008/06/custom-mediawiki-sidebar-new-blog/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;As you may have noticed, some &lt;a href="http://www.spreadfirefox.com/node&amp;amp;id=238326&amp;amp;t=305"&gt;Firefox

&lt;p&gt;After some serious grepping through the source, and adding &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt; comments
to see where they appeared, I finally found a solution to add the button
to the MediaWiki sidebar - though I&amp;#8217;d really like it to appear below the
search box (I guess that&amp;#8217;s something for my to-do list). I&amp;#8217;m using the
MonoBook skin (though somewhat modified). I&amp;#8217;m using &amp;#8220;MonoBook nouveau&amp;#8221;,
and it should be the version that shipped with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MW&lt;/span&gt; 1.10.1. In this
version, I added the code around line 166. Specifically, this was added
before the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;div id="p-search" class="portlet"&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; line, and after the end
of the &lt;code&gt;foreach ($this-&amp;gt;data['sidebar'] as $bar =&amp;gt; $cont)&lt;/code&gt; loop. This
threw the button in a box directly above the search box, and below all
of my sidebar&amp;nbsp;links.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code looked something&amp;nbsp;like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;&amp;lt;?php } ?&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In other news, I&amp;#8217;m taking a Data Driven Websites class this summer
(&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt;/MySQL, but for some reason they switched to a Windows server&amp;#8230;
endless problems, and I can&amp;#8217;t even edit with Nano on the server, let
alone emacs). Our first project was to build a blog engine, which I&amp;#8217;m
working on right now. Anyway, it got me thinking&amp;#8230; the one thing that
Blogger is missing is the ability to post to a given category, and allow
users to view or subscribe to a specific category (or everything). So I
think I may look into writing something like that myself, if I can&amp;#8217;t
find a good alternative that&amp;#8217;s already done and is F/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;OSS&lt;/span&gt;. Regardless,
I&amp;#8217;ll probably be keeping the Blogger template as well as (ugh) moving
over all of my current posts, which Blogger chose to store in raw &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt;.
So there&amp;#8217;s going to be a lot of parsing on my&amp;nbsp;future&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PS&lt;/span&gt; - When I get a new blog engine, I&amp;#8217;m also going to go for a slightly
modified template that uses relative widths and placement - so that
code, like the snippet here, fits the screen&amp;nbsp;correctly.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="blog"></category><category term="firefox"></category><category term="mediawiki"></category><category term="PHP"></category></entry><entry><title>New Project</title><link href="https://blog.jasonantman.com/2008/06/new-project/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2008-06-04T10:34:00-04:00</published><updated>2008-06-04T10:34:00-04:00</updated><author><name>admin</name></author><id>tag:blog.jasonantman.com,2008-06-04:/2008/06/new-project/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Well, TuxTruck has been temporarily put on the back burner.

the hardware, and it looks like a minimum of $1000, more like $1000 if I
get what I had originally wanted. This is complicated by the fact that
my roommates and I were just hit with a $220 electric bill. Mostly,
that&amp;#8217;s due to the central air conditioning in our apartment, and the
horrible inefficiencies with&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inefficient? Yes. At the moment, I&amp;#8217;m the only person in the apartment.
I&amp;#8217;m home for the weekend from 18:00 Friday through about 15:00 Monday. I
have class Monday-Thursday night 18:00-21:45. I work Tuesday-Friday
0900-1700. Even though the thermostat we have is &amp;#8220;programmable&amp;#8221;, it can
only be set for 4 time periods per day, weekdays and weekends. So, I
figured that a little added efficiency in calculating when the A/C
should run would go a long way towards energy&amp;nbsp;savings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My idea - tuxOstat - is to have a Linux box that has temperature sensors
placed around the apartment, and a bank of relays to control the
heating/cooling systems. So, even though I only got the idea last
Thursday, version 1 should be up and running next&amp;nbsp;week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of&amp;nbsp;hardware:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Originally I had planned on using a &lt;a href="http://www.soekris.com/net4526.htm"&gt;Soekris
    net4526&lt;/a&gt; that I had lying
    around. However, the added cost of a MiniPCI &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USB&lt;/span&gt; card seemed
    prohibitive for a one-off project. Instead, I&amp;#8217;m using an old &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HP&lt;/span&gt;
    OmniBook laptop that was already lying behind my servers. It&amp;#8217;s
    running Debian&amp;nbsp;4.0.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve ordered (just 15 minutes ago) a &lt;a href="http://www.phidgets.com/products.php?product_id=1014"&gt;Phidgets InterfaceKit
    0/0/4&lt;/a&gt;, which
    connects via &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USB&lt;/span&gt; and provides 4 relays. One will control the fan,
    one for the A/C compressor, one for the heat, and one unused (for&amp;nbsp;now).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I already had a
    &lt;a href="http://www.hobby-boards.com/catalog/product_info.php?cPath=23&amp;amp;products_id=1503"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DS9490&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    Dallas 1-wire &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USB&lt;/span&gt; adapter from
    &lt;a href="http://www.hobby-boards.com/"&gt;Hobby-Boards.com&lt;/a&gt; along with five
    &lt;a href="http://www.hobby-boards.com/catalog/product_info.php?products_id=93"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DS18S20P&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    1-wire parasite power temperature sensors. I&amp;#8217;ve wired those up with
    one in the living room near the existing thermostat, one in my
    bedroom, and one stuck about five feet up one of the A/C conduits,
    to sense when the system is actually putting out cold air. I&amp;#8217;ve had
    them logging to MySQL since 0200&amp;nbsp;today.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I decided to bite the bullet and order a beautiful &lt;a href="http://www.crystalfontz.com/products/635xes/index.html"&gt;CrystalFontz
    &lt;span class="caps"&gt;XES635BK&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TMF&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;KU&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    for the physical interface. It&amp;#8217;s a little backlit &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LCD&lt;/span&gt; display, in a
    surface-mount box, along with four bi-color LEDs and a 6-button
    keypad. That should handle the interface for anyone who doesn&amp;#8217;t want
    to grab a&amp;nbsp;console.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;#8217;ll be looking for a eight-pin header so that the relays will plug
    right in to the screw-terminal block that the thermostat uses, to
    make for easy switching to the original thermostat if needed (or
    when moving out in a&amp;nbsp;year).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, in terms of&amp;nbsp;software:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A Python text-based configuration/administration program. Will be
    accessed via &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SSH&lt;/span&gt; or &lt;span class="caps"&gt;KVM&lt;/span&gt; for the actual&amp;nbsp;machine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lots of state data stored in files under&amp;nbsp;/var.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A python script, run via cron every 2 minutes, that checks
    temperatures from the 1-wire bus, logs them to MySQL (on a remote
    host) and updates the temperature files in&amp;nbsp;/var.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A master control script, run via cron every minute, that looks at
    the temperatures, the current system state, any manual overrides
    that exist, and decides what relays should be on or&amp;nbsp;off.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A daemon to handle relay&amp;nbsp;control.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A daemon to handle the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LCD&lt;/span&gt; display output and keypad input
    (including immediate manual&amp;nbsp;overrides).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A method of providing overrides of the programmed schedule on a
    single-instance basis, i.e. &amp;#8220;system completely off from 2008-06-06
    18:00 to 2008-06-08&amp;nbsp;15:00&amp;#8221;.&lt;/li&gt;

Reader&lt;/a&gt; - I&amp;#8217;ll have to delete a few thousand
entries when I get back into the swing of things). I&amp;#8217;ve been pretty
busy, between studying, projects, and work. I&amp;#8217;ll be working 4 days a
week through June 20th, as well as taking night classes 4 nigths a week
(unfortunately not the same 4 days) through July 3, in an effort to
graduate Rutgers on time (after transferring in and also switching
majors). Work after June 20th is up in the air - who knows how hard the
budget cuts will&amp;nbsp;hit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My internship as the Sun Microsystems Campus Ambassador to Rutgers is
over on May 12th. I got a chance to do the Rutgers &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IT&lt;/span&gt; Vendor Fair with
Sun, and met a few cool people - especially including Matt McGrath of
&lt;a href="http://www.conres.com/"&gt;Continental Resources&lt;/a&gt;, a Sun Strategic iForce
Partner, who&amp;#8217;s doing some wonderful things with the &lt;a href="http://www.sun.com/solutions/landing/industry/education/edu_essentials.jsp"&gt;Sun Education
Essentials Matching Grant
Program&lt;/a&gt;,
and &lt;a href="http://opsamericas.com/"&gt;Skip Paul&lt;/a&gt;, a Linux Systems Engineer for
Novell&amp;#8217;s Open Platform Solutions group. I also finally cracked open my
demo set of &lt;a href="http://www.sunspotworld.com/"&gt;SunSPOT&lt;/a&gt;s. Wonderful little
devices, radio, run Java on the bare metal, and have temperature
sensors, accelerometers, and liberal I/O. My first development exereice
will probably be making a temperature and acceleration data logger for
my truck, but there&amp;#8217;s surely more to come. They&amp;#8217;re&amp;nbsp;great!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My newest project - which I&amp;#8217;m hoping to spend nearly the whole summer on
- is the &lt;a href="http://www.jasonantman.com/tuxtruck/"&gt;TuxTruck&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;#8217;ve been
frustrated with the lack of &amp;#8220;smartness&amp;#8221; in my truck (an 06 Ford F-250),
not to mention having to remember my &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MP3&lt;/span&gt; player so I can listen to
podcasts on the way to work, and having so many gadgets in my truck. So,
the solution is obvious: a Linux-based
&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpc"&gt;CarPC&lt;/a&gt;. A nice little Mini-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ATX&lt;/span&gt; box
under a seat, with a 7&amp;#8221; pull-out touchscreen in the dash (replacing the
factory radio). It&amp;#8217;s a big, complicated, and expensive project - but I
want one, and I could use some experience with smaller systems.&lt;br&gt;
The major features I have&amp;nbsp;planned:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Realtime &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPS&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;navigation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hands-free bluetooth calls from my cell, with address book, routing
    to contact address, possibly voice&amp;nbsp;dialing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Realtime&amp;nbsp;weather&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;OBD&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;II&lt;/span&gt; interface, for vehicle diagnostics and fuel
    efficiency/performance&amp;nbsp;profiling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Audio - at a minimum searching and playing MP3s, and automatically
    downloading podcasts and throwing them in a playlist. Perhaps also
    an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AM&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;FM&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;tuner&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s not an easy project. So far, the major challenges seem to&amp;nbsp;be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No full-featured &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPS&lt;/span&gt; navigation package available. The ones that are
    available don&amp;#8217;t seem to be too easy to integrate into my planned
    &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GUI&lt;/span&gt;, which will allot them 800x420 pixels (on an 800x480 screen) and
    requre the bottom toolbar to be always&amp;nbsp;available.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to handle processing of multiple data streams that require
    near-real-time processing - specifically, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPS&lt;/span&gt; with text-to-speech,
    turn-by-turn directions, plus playing audio, plus responding to an
    incoming phone call in a timely manner, pausing the audio, and
    stopping &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPS&lt;/span&gt; audio but continuing&amp;nbsp;navigation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whether to install a smaller stereo and use aux input for audio, or
    totally rip out the stereo, use an amp with the computer as its only
    input, and then how to control&amp;nbsp;volume?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be more to come in the future. For now, take a look at &lt;a href="https://github.com/jantman/tuxtruck"&gt;the
TuxTruck github&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update Saturday, March 2, 2013&lt;/strong&gt; - I&amp;#8217;m in the process of migrating my
legacy &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CVS&lt;/span&gt; and Subversion repositories to
&lt;a href="http://github.com/jantman/"&gt;github.com&lt;/a&gt;. The forgotten &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SVN&lt;/span&gt; repository
for TuxTruck has been migrated there, and the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CVS&lt;/span&gt; repository will soon
be moved there as well. Tuxtruck.org has been permanently taken offline
and redirected to the GitHub&amp;nbsp;repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mediawiki Logging&lt;/strong&gt; - I recently
had a situation where I had to confirm how much work someone had done on
a MediaWiki-based project. The Recent Changes page only goes back 30
days, and walking through the History of each page is a pain. After
looking around in the database a bit, I found a few tables of&amp;nbsp;interest:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Table &amp;#8220;users&amp;#8221; includes fields &amp;#8220;user_touched&amp;#8221; (last time the user
    was updated) and &amp;#8220;user_editcount&amp;#8221; (a really simple count of the
    users&amp;#8217; number of&amp;nbsp;edits).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Table &amp;#8220;recentchanges&amp;#8221; holds a lot of data&amp;#8230; seemingly the entire
    life of the&amp;nbsp;wiki&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

for him, so I figured I&amp;#8217;d give my own webalizer installation a check.
Wow - 30,215 hits this month alone. That reminded me of a problem with
my ignored hosts - 17,600 of those hits were Googlebot, and another
2,065 were Yandex (a Russian search&amp;nbsp;engine).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazingly, though, it seems like Google is only indexing my blog. My
precious wiki seems out of whack, not to metion my &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CVS&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, this reminded me of two long-overdue&amp;nbsp;tasks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get webalizer to properly ignore the common&amp;nbsp;bots.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get sitemaps of my entire&amp;nbsp;site.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, off to the&amp;nbsp;races!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, I added Googlebot, Yandex, and a few others to webalizer.conf
with IgnoreAgent directives. Then, after clearing out my entire output
directory - and waiting a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LONG&lt;/span&gt; time for it to run - bingo! Real stats.
Down to about 8000 hits for the month, which seems more logical, even
including the \~2,000 hits from Google&amp;nbsp;feedfetcher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next stop was sitemaps. It tooks some &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt; magic to hack apart the
MediaWiki sitemaps, put in the correct URLs (it was showing an
internal-only hostname), and drop all that and my Blogger rss.xml in an
index file. It&amp;#8217;s now 2 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AM&lt;/span&gt;, and it just crashed and burned - the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt;
script worked fine, but for some reason my entries in
sitemaps_index.xml - which pointed to sitemaps in a subdirectory - came
back with errors. Well, something to work on&amp;nbsp;tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This morning I checked my backups and noticed that nothing had run in 3
days. It turns out I just had one failed job holding everything up. And
I screwed up - I was home this weekend and forgot to swap tapes. It&amp;#8217;ll
be another 2 weeks before I can. But, I took the time to setup a backup
status box on my administrative portal (more on that later) and will
also be revising my apparently ineffectual Nagios check&amp;nbsp;script.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a few side notes: First, I&amp;#8217;m seriously thinking of dumping Verizon
FiOS. While I really like the service, their static &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IP&lt;/span&gt; (business)
variant is $100/month for 15 Mbps down / 2 Mbps up, whereas
Cablevision&amp;#8217;s Optimum Business with static &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IP&lt;/span&gt; is $55/month for 30 Mbps
down / 5 Mbps&amp;nbsp;up!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the previous projects have been put on hold for the time being

(in the basement of my suburban home, so headroom is limited to about
six feet), I&amp;#8217;ll probably move one or two machines from my apartment back
there, reorganize things, and setup a Zenoss test (*if* I can get Xen
to play well with some &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OS&lt;/span&gt; that has Zenoss RPMs, or give up and compile

A few of my new&amp;nbsp;projects:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Some embedded Linux&amp;nbsp;work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Getting my new &lt;a href="http://www.deluogps.com/product.php?id=10-311-00"&gt;Deluo &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USB&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WAAS&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; working with
    my eeePC, and eventually add software for mapping wireless&amp;nbsp;networks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mount an external 2.4GHz antenna on my truck, so I can hop on
    &lt;a href="http://ruwireless.rutgers.edu/"&gt;RUwireless&lt;/a&gt; without leaving the
    comfort of my home on&amp;nbsp;wheels.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get a &amp;#8220;N&amp;#8221; wireless card and beta the wireless-N at&amp;nbsp;Rutgers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Figure out development for PalmOS, and write a program to sync my
    Palm calendar with &lt;a href="http://calendar.google.com/"&gt;Google Calendar&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;over-the-air.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do some work with a radio scanner and a system at home for recording
    and logging (maybe even
    &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MDC-1200"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;MDC1200&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;decoding).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My pet peeve for the day - blogs and other websites that don&amp;#8217;t list a
date last updated. I&amp;#8217;ve been looking around for alternatives to
&lt;a href="http://cvs.codeyard.net/kpilot/"&gt;KPilot&lt;/a&gt;, and I have to look through
all of the Google results, and figure out how old they are based on
version numbers and which Palm devices are&amp;nbsp;listed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, from Rutgers Telecommunications, this is what RUwireless looked
like over spring break, and the Monday that everyone came&amp;nbsp;back:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, my racks both at home and at the apartment are atrocious. They
have no cable management at all. Both started with 1-3 machines, and no
real plans for upgrades (since they&amp;#8217;re just my personal/development
machines). Unfortunately, the &amp;#8220;rack&amp;#8221; (a metal workshop shelving unit) at
home now has 8 machines and a host of ancillary equipment. The one at
the apartment - an actual 42U rack - has 5 plus a few switches,
rackmount &lt;span class="caps"&gt;KMM&lt;/span&gt;, etc. They&amp;#8217;re both a jumble of wires in the back.
Unfortunately, it seems like cable management hardware is *epxensive*.
$30 for a 2U metal blank with a few plastic split D-rings, or almost $40
for a 2-meter vertical hunk of plastic channel with slits in the sides?
So, I&amp;#8217;ve been vaguely considering what it will take to fabricate some
cable management hardware of my own. Probably just building something
out of rack blanks for the horizontal off of the switches, and buying
some sort of vertical channel for power and networking/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;KVM&lt;/span&gt;. Man, those
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;KVM&lt;/span&gt; cables sure do take up a lot of space. Also at the moment, at home
my power is all coming directly out of two UPSs, whereas at the
apartment it&amp;#8217;s straight from mains off of a surge suppressor. I&amp;#8217;s like
to buy another &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UPS&lt;/span&gt; for the apartment from RefurbUPS.com, where I got the
ones from home, and also add a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PDU&lt;/span&gt; at home and a vertical power strip at
the&amp;nbsp;apartment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, at the apartment, the roommates and I have had some discussion
lately about how much power the machines draw. This mainly stemmed from
our plans to move this June, into a rented house with two more people.
This seems to be falling through, so I don&amp;#8217;t have to worry about moving
and re-cabling everything, but I&amp;#8217;m still interested in finding out how
much power is being drawn. Granted, my UPSs at home give me a
more-or-less good idea of power consumption, but I&amp;#8217;d like to know in
detail. The ideal solution would be a clamp ammeter around the mains
line to the equipment - one with a serial interface. Unfortunately, I
can&amp;#8217;t seem to find such a thing, short of a digital multimeter left on
all the time. So, I guess I&amp;#8217;ll be looking around, and if I can&amp;#8217;t find
anything specific, maybe I&amp;#8217;ll work on a microcontroller that can read
1-200mV in 1mV increments, and use it with an inductive clamp ammeter
(usual output for them is 1mV per&amp;nbsp;A).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, on Monday I got into work and couldn&amp;#8217;t access my mailserver. Weird.
I never even got any Nagios alerts. I checked Nagios and&amp;#8230; nothing. As
in no connection. I &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SSH&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;d home and pinged both boxes, but nothing. The
switch showed the mail server totally offline, and the Nagios box
plugged connected but &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ZERO&lt;/span&gt; data out. I reset the counters and waited.
Still nothing. After an hour or so of poking around, I determined that
both devices were on the same 6-port group on the switch, and nothing
else there was up too. So, after five long hours, I got someone back
home to switch the cables. Still nothing. On a hunch, I asked to have
her check the mail server (the &amp;#8220;new&amp;#8221; Sun Blade 150) and, sure enough, it
wasn&amp;#8217;t powered on. A click of the power button, and the mail server was
back online. Along with an ominous last email from Nagios, stating that
the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UPS&lt;/span&gt; running my switch lost power, and 6 minutes later, was going
down hard. Then&amp;nbsp;quiet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t usually have power outages. So I&amp;#8217;ll admit, when I added some of
the new machines, I committed a high sin - I &amp;#8220;never got around&amp;#8221; to
setting up everything power-wise. I also have the switch running off of
an old BackUPS &lt;span class="caps"&gt;500VA&lt;/span&gt; unit, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USB&lt;/span&gt;, without automatic self-tests. As a
result of all&amp;nbsp;this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The little &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UPS&lt;/span&gt; powering the switch only held out for 6-7 minutes. As
    a result, once that died, the bigger units didn&amp;#8217;t even matter, as
    all hope was lost. This needs to be on a bigger &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UPS&lt;/span&gt; - maybe one of
    the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;1000VA&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s until it gets its&amp;#8217;&amp;nbsp;own.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;APCupsd requires a network to initiate shutdown, so the rest of the
    machines came down hard (as confirmed by looking through log&amp;nbsp;files).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The SunBlade was never setup to power on after power interruption,
    so it just sat there like a&amp;nbsp;brick.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most disturbingly, while my Nagios/monitoring box is up (according to
the switch, power draw figures from the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UPS&lt;/span&gt;, and the lights, as
confirmed by someone on-site), it&amp;#8217;s dead. No ping, nothing out. I&amp;#8217;ll
have to look into it, but it made me realize that this really is my only
way of analyzing problems. That needs to&amp;nbsp;stop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe one day I&amp;#8217;ll have the money for a nice &lt;a href="http://www.apc.com/products/family/index.cfm?id=223"&gt;SmartUPS
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;RT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or even a
&lt;a href="http://www.apc.com/products/family/index.cfm?id=189"&gt;Symmetra&lt;/a&gt; - though
getting 208V into my basement is even more of a dream than spending
$4000 on a&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;UPS&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, I decided (after all this) to setup graphing of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UPS&lt;/span&gt; data (load,
voltage in and out, temp, capacity, run time, etc.). While I haven&amp;#8217;t
gotten around to setting up &lt;a href="http://www.zenoss.com/"&gt;Zenoss&lt;/a&gt; yet, I did
a quick (well, 4 hours later I&amp;#8217;m done configuring it)
&lt;a href="http://www.cacti.net/"&gt;Cacti&lt;/a&gt;installation on my web server (I should
already have it running on the monitoring box, but who knows what that
will look like when I get&amp;nbsp;home).&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="apc"></category><category term="cable management"></category><category term="cacti"></category><category term="disaster"></category><category term="monitoring"></category><category term="power distribution"></category><category term="power failure"></category><category term="rack"></category><category term="UPS"></category></entry><entry><title>February 26, 2008</title><link href="https://blog.jasonantman.com/2008/02/february-26-2008/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2008-02-26T11:32:00-05:00</published><updated>2008-02-26T11:32:00-05:00</updated><author><name>admin</name></author><id>tag:blog.jasonantman.com,2008-02-26:/2008/02/february-26-2008/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Well, while I haven&amp;#8217;t made much progress on anything interesting -

mainly my &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NMS&lt;/span&gt; comparison or any of my other projects - due to my busy
schedule, I did get an hour or two to clean up my network at the
apartment, swapping out my 24-port Linksys switch in my room for the
5-port Netgear previously used for printing. I threw all of the printers
and the print server on their own &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VLAN&lt;/span&gt; on the main 3com&amp;nbsp;switch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve also started thinking more about &lt;a href="http://www.mythtv.org/"&gt;MythTV&lt;/a&gt; -
I use it for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TV&lt;/span&gt; in my room (feeding a grossly insufficient 21&amp;#8221; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CRT&lt;/span&gt;
monitor), and my roommate has a Dell &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GX270&lt;/span&gt; by the big &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TV&lt;/span&gt; in the living
room, though it was running Freevo (and now has a dead tuner and no &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RAM&lt;/span&gt;,
or something like that). So, I decided that I might do things right -
drop a 5- or 8-port GigE switch in the apartment, put GigE NICs in the
two boxes with tuners (putting MythTV on the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GX270&lt;/span&gt; also), and setting up
a centralized system. The problem is that the ideal solution would be a
single dedicated back-end system for storage and control, with the two
tuner/video out boxes just providing A/V I/O. Unfortunately, the two
boxes with tuners are both high-spec&amp;#8217;ed P4&amp;#8217;s, and I&amp;#8217;m not sure what I
can come up with in terms of a server for the&amp;nbsp;backend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, &lt;em&gt;the question for anyone who may be
reading&lt;/em&gt; - I&amp;#8217;d like to setup a good amount (1-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;2TB&lt;/span&gt;) of storage for
this. My roommate wants a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RAID&lt;/span&gt; configuration, but I don&amp;#8217;t see the need
for videos - if I lose my &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TV&lt;/span&gt; recordings, I set MythTV to record it again
the next time it&amp;#8217;s on. Anyway, I have an 8-bay external &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SCAI&lt;/span&gt; enclosure
and cards in all of the servers, but &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SCSI&lt;/span&gt; disks are expensive. I was
thinking of going to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SATA&lt;/span&gt; 3.0. Most likely, I&amp;#8217;d get some sort of 4-8
disk enclosure, start with 1-3 disks in the 400-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;750GB&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, the question - what type of system specs would be needed to stream
audio and video, uncompressed, perhaps even &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HDTV&lt;/span&gt; (we have the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TV&lt;/span&gt; and
cable box, would just need an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HD&lt;/span&gt; tuner) to remote storage over the
network? I was thinking of doing either a Linux master MythTV backend
with eSATA cards, or letting each &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TV&lt;/span&gt; computer be its&amp;#8217; own backend, and
then doing Solaris/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ZFS&lt;/span&gt; with iSCSI or ATAoE. Any suggestions? I&amp;#8217;m pretty
much thinking of using a PowerEdge 2550 for&amp;nbsp;this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I&amp;#8217;m also filling up my backup disks at home, and don&amp;#8217;t want to
shorten my expiration cycle. My nightly backup runs put quite a strain
on my main Fast Ethernet &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LAN&lt;/span&gt;, so I&amp;#8217;ve been planning for a while on
moving to GigE. My thought at home is to setup a second, separate GigE
switch/lan, with GigE NICs in all of the servers. Not exactly cheap, but
I can pickup a Linux-/Solaris-compatible Negear &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GA311&lt;/span&gt; for around $40, in
addition to the Intel Pro/1000 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;XT&lt;/span&gt; and Asante GigaNIC that I already
have. The problem here is finding a good GigE switch - I&amp;#8217;d really like
something with Telnet, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SNMP&lt;/span&gt;, VLANs, the&amp;nbsp;works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other news, I highly recommend reading the &lt;a href="http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20080221184924826"&gt;Groklaw story on
Microsoft&amp;#8217;s latest pledge for
interoperability&lt;/a&gt;.
I especially liked the one quote from the &lt;a href="http://www.ecis.eu/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ECIS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;statement:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For years now, Microsoft has either failed to implement or has
actively corrupted a range of truly open standards adopted and
implemented by the rest of the industry. Unless and until that
behaviour stops, today&amp;#8217;s words mean&amp;nbsp;nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More fundamentally, today&amp;#8217;s announcement is still all about the rest
of the world interoperating with Microsoft on Microsoft&amp;#8217;s own terms,
not the other way&amp;nbsp;around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#8217;s even links to &lt;em&gt;ten&lt;/em&gt; previous Microsoft statements promising&amp;nbsp;interoperability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing is, this is a promise to interoperate with old-fashioned
competitors. It doesn&amp;#8217;t enable interoperability with the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPL&lt;/span&gt;, which is
not compatible with patent licenses, and that is Microsoft&amp;#8217;s true&amp;nbsp;competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From Michael Cunningham, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VP&lt;/span&gt; and General Counsel of Red&amp;nbsp;Hat:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eight years ago the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; regulatory authorities, and four years ago
the European regulators made clear to Microsoft that its refusal to
disclose interface information for its monopoly software products
violates the law. So, it is hardly surprising to see even Microsoft
state today that “interoperability across systems is an important
requirement” and announce a “change in [its] approach to
interoperability.” Of course, we’ve heard similar announcements
before, almost always strategically timed for other effect. Red Hat
regards this most recent announcement with a healthy dose of
skepticism. Three commitments by Microsoft would show that it really
means what it is announcing&amp;nbsp;today:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Commit to open standards: Rather than pushing forward its
    proprietary, Windows-based formats for document processing, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OOXML&lt;/span&gt;,
    Microsoft should embrace the existing &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISO&lt;/span&gt;-approved, cross-platform
    industry standard for document processing, Open Document Format
    (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ODF&lt;/span&gt;) at the International Standards Organization’s meeting next
    week in Geneva. Microsoft, please demonstrate implementation of an
    existing international open standard now rather than make press
    announcements about intentions of future standards&amp;nbsp;support.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Commit to interoperability with open source: Instead of offering a
    patent license for its protocol information on the basis of
    licensing arrangements it knows are incompatible with the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPL&lt;/span&gt; –
    the world’s most widely used open source software license –
    Microsoft should extend its Open Specification Promise to all of
    the interoperability information that it is announcing today will
    be made available. The Open Specification Promise already covers
    many Microsoft products that do not have monopoly market
    positions. If Microsoft were truly committed to fostering openness
    and preventing customer lock-in, it would extend this promise to
    the protocol and interface information it intends to disclose
    today. There is no explanation for refusing to extend the Open
    Specification Promise to “high-volume” products, other than a
    continued intention on Microsoft’s part to lock customers into its
    monopoly products, and lock out competitors through patent&amp;nbsp;threats.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Commit to competition on a level playing field: Microsoft’s
    announcement today appears carefully crafted to foreclose
    competition from the open source community. How else can you
    explain a “promise not to sue open source developers” as long as
    they develop and distribute only*/ “non-commercial”
    implementations of interoperable products? This is simply
    disingenuous. The only hope for reintroducing competition to the
    monopoly markets Microsoft now controls – Windows, Office, etc. –
    is through commercial distributions of competitive open source
    software&amp;nbsp;products.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;cd&lt;/code&gt; into &lt;code&gt;hyperic-hq-installer&lt;/code&gt; and run &lt;code&gt;./setup.sh -full&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The installation can&amp;#8217;t be run as root (though I assumed it would
    need root&amp;nbsp;privileges).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I selected to install all 3 components - Server, Shell, and&amp;nbsp;Agent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Well, whoops! Sorta stupid to not allow installation as root,
    when the default location to install to is &lt;code&gt;/home/hyperic&lt;/code&gt;. How
    do they expect an arbitrary user to install there? Even worse,
    it appears that the default OpenSuSE 10.3 installation doesn&amp;#8217;t
    come with &lt;code&gt;sudo&lt;/code&gt; (!!!!) so I can&amp;#8217;t try&amp;nbsp;that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As root, create &lt;code&gt;/home/hyperic&lt;/code&gt; and chown to my&amp;nbsp;user.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Repear the above steps (well, hopefully not all of&amp;nbsp;them).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Default ports for everything - web &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GUI&lt;/span&gt; on 7080, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTTPS&lt;/span&gt; web &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GUI&lt;/span&gt; on
    7443, jnp service on 2099, mbean server on&amp;nbsp;9093,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Change domain names in default URLs to logical ones for my test
    environment (no real &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DNS&lt;/span&gt;, just IPcop hosts, so
    devel-hyperic1.localdomian). I hope that I can change these
    later, or even better that absolute paths aren&amp;#8217;t used too much,
    as this will screw with my idea of using &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SSH&lt;/span&gt; port forwarding for
    remote&amp;nbsp;access.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Leave the default &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SMTP&lt;/span&gt; server alone and change it later - I
    odn&amp;#8217;t even have mail running here at the&amp;nbsp;apartment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use the built-in PostgreSQL database with default port of&amp;nbsp;9432.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go with the defaults for everything after&amp;nbsp;this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Everything runs nicely, and then it tells you to login to
    another terminal as root and run a script. I&amp;#8217;m not sure I like
    this method, but I guess it works. Login and do&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How will it start the builtin database? As my user???? Yup.
    postgres is running as my user. Wonderful. Nothing in the
    &lt;a href="http://support.hyperic.com/confluence/display/DOC/Full+Installation+Guide" title="http://support.hyperic.com/confluence/display/DOC/Full+Installation+Guide"&gt;install
    document&lt;/a&gt;
    mentioned user creation. Was this just assumed? Because in the
    naive world I live in, most installer scripts (think Nagios)
    create a user for you, or tell you&amp;nbsp;to.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Setup script complete. A few instructions&amp;nbsp;follow&amp;#8230;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Run &lt;code&gt;/home/hyperic/server-3.2.0/bin/hq-server.sh start&lt;/code&gt;&amp;#8230; as my
    user. &lt;em&gt;Note to self:&lt;/em&gt; setup a user for Postgres and Hyperic. Believe
    it or not, but it booted - but followed with the message, &amp;#8220;Login to
    &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HQ&lt;/span&gt; at:
    &lt;a href="http://127.0.0.1:7080/" title="http://127.0.0.1:7080/"&gt;http://127.0.0.1:7080/&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Browsed to
    &lt;a href="http://devel-hyperic1:7080/" title="http://devel-hyperic1:7080"&gt;http://devel-hyperic1:7080&lt;/a&gt;
    and was greeted by a startup page, saying that the server was 18%
    finished booting. My, I yearn for little C binaries and a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;frontend.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Page turns blank and stops there. I refresh, and get a login page. I
    enter my username and password, and get a little message box where
    the &amp;#8220;invalid password&amp;#8221; box usually is - says &amp;#8220;Server is still
    booting&amp;#8221;. This is over a minute later. I&amp;#8217;m happy to see
    Apache/Coyote1.1, but would like to be able to get into Hyperic in
    less time than it takes the machine to boot to a graphical login
    screen (ok, granted, I&amp;#8217;m running &lt;span class="caps"&gt;XFCE&lt;/span&gt;). In SuSE&amp;#8217;s YaST Xen Monitor,
    I see that the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VM&lt;/span&gt; is at 45% of its&amp;#8217; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;464MB&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RAM&lt;/span&gt;, and 90% &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CPU&lt;/span&gt; - with
    8.5% consumed by&amp;nbsp;dom0.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CPU&lt;/span&gt; usage for the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VM&lt;/span&gt; drops to 1% and I login again. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BAM&lt;/span&gt;! Hyperic &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HQ&lt;/span&gt;.
    Aside from the fact that it shows &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NO&lt;/span&gt; resources&amp;#8230; oh&amp;#8230; start the&amp;nbsp;Agent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start the Agent on the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VM&lt;/span&gt; running Hyperic. It asks me for the server
    &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IP&lt;/span&gt; address. What, no &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DNS&lt;/span&gt;? I enter the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IP&lt;/span&gt; as it is&amp;#8230; for now. I keep
    everything at defaults, including using the hqadmin username and
    password. Successfully&amp;nbsp;started.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;BAM&lt;/span&gt;! In Dashboard, I see the auto-discovered host with the right
    hostname, as well as Tomcat, Agent, JBoss, and PostgreSQL. Amazing!
    Click &amp;#8220;Add to&amp;nbsp;Inventory&amp;#8221;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check out the &amp;#8220;Resources&amp;#8221; -&gt; &amp;#8220;Browse&amp;#8221; screen. It knows this machine
    is OpenSuSE 10.3, and I see my four services (listed above). Of
    course, no metrics yet, but I see the correct &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IP&lt;/span&gt;, gateway, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DNS&lt;/span&gt;,
    vendor (SuSE), kernel version, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RAM&lt;/span&gt;, architecture, and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CPU&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;speed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Looking through the &amp;#8220;Inventory&amp;#8221; screen, I see everything - NICs and
    MACs, running servers and one service (a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CPU&lt;/span&gt; resource). What more
    could a man want in&amp;#8230;let&amp;#8217;s see.. just over an&amp;nbsp;hour!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I really *love* the &amp;#8220;Views&amp;#8221; screen which, even out-of-the-box,
    allows &amp;#8220;Live Exec&amp;#8221; information from cpuinfo, df, ifconfig, netstat,
    top, who, and&amp;nbsp;more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Well, it&amp;#8217;s 03:35, and I have work and class tomorrow. I think it&amp;#8217;s
    time to give Part I a rest. But&amp;nbsp;first&amp;#8230;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go to the &amp;#8220;Platform&amp;#8221; page for my one machine and&amp;#8230; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;YES&lt;/span&gt;! Graphs are
    starting to&amp;nbsp;appear!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Following the suggestion
    &lt;a href="http://support.hyperic.com/confluence/display/DOC/HQ+Quick+Start#HQQuickStart-enableTracking" title="http://support.hyperic.com/confluence/display/DOC/HQ+Quick+Start#HQQuickStart-enableTracking"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;,
    I enable log and config tracking on the platform for &lt;code&gt;/var/log/warn&lt;/code&gt;
    and &lt;code&gt;/etc/hosts&lt;/code&gt;,&amp;nbsp;respecitvely.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Before I call it a night (now 03:42), I stop back at the &lt;a href="http://www.hyperic.com/downloads/dl-hq-oss.html" title="http://www.hyperic.com/downloads/dl-hq-oss.html"&gt;downloads
    page&lt;/a&gt;
    and grab the Linux x86 Agent for the dom0 machine, hoping to get
    some physical information as well. While I&amp;#8217;m at it, I grab the Linux
    &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AMD64&lt;/span&gt; Agent to try on my laptop. I create &amp;#8220;hyperic&amp;#8221; users on each
    system. On the base Xen server, I give it a shot and get &amp;#8220;Unable to
    register agent: Error communicating with agent: Unauthorized&amp;#8221;. Same
    thing on the&amp;nbsp;laptop.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Did a little reading
    &lt;a href="http://support.hyperic.com/confluence/display/DOC/Installation+Non-Windows#InstallationNon-Windows-install" title="http://support.hyperic.com/confluence/display/DOC/Installation+Non-Windows#InstallationNon-Windows-install"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
    As to keeping all of the defaults, it turns out that both clients
    had firewalls blocking &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TCP&lt;/span&gt; port 2144. I opened it up on both, and
    also set the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IP&lt;/span&gt; address (that the server uses to contact the client)
    to the correct ones. Viola! Now I have 3 clients connected, and
    gatheirng data for the next \~16 hours until I have time to check it
    out&amp;nbsp;agian.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More to come in Part &lt;span class="caps"&gt;II&lt;/span&gt; tomorrow - actually doing something with
Hyperic. For&lt;br&gt;
now (04:08), time to&amp;nbsp;sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="part-ii-configuration"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#part-ii-configuration"&gt;Part &lt;span class="caps"&gt;II&lt;/span&gt; -&amp;nbsp;Configuration&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I haven&amp;#8217;t had much time to play with Hyperic in the two
days&lt;br&gt;
since installation. The most I&amp;#8217;ve really done is setup Agents on my
laptop,&lt;br&gt;
desktop, and the host machine (both dom0 and domU for Hyperic), so that
they&lt;br&gt;
start to collect&amp;nbsp;data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I found a lot of upsetting stuff in the features list (see below),
I&lt;br&gt;
decided to go ahead and add some other devices. On the network at the&lt;br&gt;
apartment, I have two manageable switches (a Linksys and a 3Com) - which
pretty&lt;br&gt;
much make up the sum of non-host equipment. I also have an IPcop box,
though I&lt;br&gt;
assume the standard Linux Agent will handle that. The one item missing
that I&lt;br&gt;
have at home is my set of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;APC&lt;/span&gt; SmartUPS UPSs with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SNMP&lt;/span&gt; cards, but I guess
I&amp;#8217;ll&lt;br&gt;
just have to skip them for this&amp;nbsp;review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, I went in and added a platform (Resources-&gt;Browse, Tools
Menu-&gt;Add&lt;br&gt;
Platform) for the 3Com switch (a SuperStack &lt;span class="caps"&gt;II&lt;/span&gt; Switch 3300). It showed&lt;br&gt;
successful creation - but nothing else. I went in and entered the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SNMP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
community string, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IP&lt;/span&gt;, and version (1). In about a minute or so, I
started to&lt;br&gt;
see metrics - Availability, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IP&lt;/span&gt; Forwards, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IP&lt;/span&gt; In Receives, an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IP&lt;/span&gt; In
Received per&lt;br&gt;
Second. While it&amp;#8217;s quite basic, that&amp;#8217;s good for a starting point. While
the&lt;br&gt;
[&lt;a href="http://support.hyperic.com/confluence/display/DOCSHQ30/Network+Device+platform" title="http://support.hyperic.com/confluence/display/DOCSHQ30/Network+Device+platform"&gt;http://support.hyperic.com/confluence/display/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DOCSHQ30&lt;/span&gt;/Network+Device+platform&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Network Device Platform] documentation lists lots of metrics that can
be&lt;br&gt;
enabled, I&amp;#8217;d also like telnet availability and - my big one since I use
a&lt;br&gt;
&amp;#8220;cute&amp;#8221; (crappy) IPcop installation for local &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DNS&lt;/span&gt;, a dig on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DNS&lt;/span&gt; to make
sure&lt;br&gt;
the entry is there. In the Monitor screen, I was able to enable a bunch
of&lt;br&gt;
additional metrics (by clicking on the &amp;#8220;Show All Metrics&amp;#8221; link), though&lt;br&gt;
there&amp;#8217;s also no way (that I can find) to monitor the status of
individual&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;ports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, I browsed through the &amp;#8220;Administration&amp;#8221; pages, setup a few users,
and&lt;br&gt;
started setting *way* more default metrics for various platforms,
services,&lt;br&gt;
and servers. While I don&amp;#8217;t have mail running yet, that will come this&lt;br&gt;
weekend. While I added a lot of things as &amp;#8220;Default On&amp;#8221;, I still need to
go&lt;br&gt;
back and add more things in the templates as&amp;nbsp;Indicators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also added some escalations, though they&amp;#8217;re quite simple - you can
notify &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HQ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
users or &amp;#8220;other users&amp;#8221; by email or &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SMS&lt;/span&gt;, write to SysLog, or suppress
alerts&lt;br&gt;
for 0 minutes to 24 hours. Hopefully I&amp;#8217;ll also find a plugin for
Asterisk&lt;br&gt;
integration. One striking omission is user groups. Also, the concept of&lt;br&gt;
&amp;#8220;Roles&amp;#8221; (maybe their idea of groups?) is only available in the
Enterprise&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, I also notice one other majoe issue, though perhaps I&amp;#8217;ll
find a&lt;br&gt;
solution in my experimentation - there doesn&amp;#8217;t be a way to setup
default&lt;br&gt;
alerts for metrics. If they have all of this platform, server, and
service&lt;br&gt;
information defined as default templates, why not just have a way to
assign&lt;br&gt;
default users (and groups) to these objects, and have default alerts&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;generated?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of Apache 2.2 monitoring, out-of-the-box, nothing worked. No
metrics&lt;br&gt;
at all. Firstly, Hyperic requires the mod_status module. Persoanlly,
I&amp;#8217;d&lt;br&gt;
rather handle all of that through a backend, like Nagios. Secondly, it
got the&lt;br&gt;
pidfile and apache2ctl paths wrong. Furthermore, it has no &amp;#8220;smart&amp;#8221;
checking for resources - while my Apache 2.2 resource config was clearly
wrong (wrong &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PID&lt;/span&gt; file path, no mod_status), Hyperic didn&amp;#8217;t detect this
and was showing the resource as&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8220;Down&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that, I setup a bunch of alerts for things that I thought would be
off-kilter a lot (like &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WARN&lt;/span&gt; log entries on my laptop, high memory usage
on some stressed machines, etc.) as well as log and config file
monitoring and alerts for them. While I didn&amp;#8217;t have mail working yet, I
figured I might as well get that stuff&amp;nbsp;running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the Xen dom0 host that runs the Hyperic vm (box called xenmaster1), I
wasn&amp;#8217;t able to add config file tracking for any of the /etc/xen/ files.
At this point I notice some serious shortcomings - not only is it not
possible to define a template of alerts for a given
platform/server/service, it&amp;#8217;s also impossible to define a template for
alerts. I also noticed that it&amp;#8217;s not possible to define groups of
contacts. This wasn&amp;#8217;t much of a problem for my test installation - the
alerts are only going to my roommate and I - but it would surely be an
issue in any larger&amp;nbsp;setting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point in configuration, I come to a make-or-break point. With
some of these shortcomings, I really need a way to call a script with
alert information when an alert is generated - whether it&amp;#8217;s to dial out
through Asterisk or just automatically create a ticket for the&amp;nbsp;problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adding alerts is a cumbersome process. You have to browse to a page for
a specific metric - which means going to the page for a specific
platform, server, or service - and then opening the page for that
metric. The actual alert creation takes up two pages - one for the
metric, threshold, and time-based criteria, and a second for who to
alert. This means that to add alerts for a machine, you need to view the
platform page as well as the services and servers pages, and each metric&amp;nbsp;therein.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ll be posting some more in the days to come. From a &lt;a href="http://forums.hyperic.com/jiveforums/thread.jspa?messageID=14561&amp;amp;#14561"&gt;post at the
Hyperic
Forums&lt;/a&gt;,
I was able to find out that a Xen plugin is in the works, but for the
Open Source version, the only way to trigger a script is to send an
email and have it handled by a filter such as&amp;nbsp;Procmail.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="hyperic"></category><category term="monitoring"></category><category term="open source"></category></entry><entry><title>Network Monitoring (lack of) Progress</title><link href="https://blog.jasonantman.com/2008/02/network-monitoring-lack-of-progress/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2008-02-06T00:07:00-05:00</published><updated>2008-02-06T00:07:00-05:00</updated><author><name>admin</name></author><id>tag:blog.jasonantman.com,2008-02-06:/2008/02/network-monitoring-lack-of-progress/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;So, I&amp;#8217;ve been plodding along after troubleshooting some &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VPN&lt;/span&gt; issues with

&lt;p&gt;Now, problem 2. I&amp;#8217;m trying to use the SuSE/YaST builtin &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VM&lt;/span&gt; manager.
Unfortunately, it can&amp;#8217;t read half of my known-good SuSE CDs, and for
some reason the other half come up with a mysterious error that it can&amp;#8217;t
find /tmp/{random string}/suse/i586/install-initrd-1.0-72.i586.rpm. This
is most troubling because I have 2 VMs setup on the machine, and
installed them both without a&amp;nbsp;problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By now a new OpenSuSE 10.3-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;KDE&lt;/span&gt; .iso should be done downloading (thank

&lt;p&gt;On another note, later this week I&amp;#8217;m going to setup two virtual machines
on my spare PowerEdge 650 to test some &lt;a href="/2008/01/network-monitoring.html"&gt;network monitoring
systems&lt;/a&gt;
- specifically, &lt;a href="http://www.hyperic.com/products/hq_oss.html"&gt;Hyperic

Thanks to &lt;a href="http://www.johnmwillis.com"&gt;John&lt;/a&gt;, Peter, and &lt;a href="http://jeffgehlbach.com/"&gt;Jeff
G&lt;/a&gt;. (of OpenNMS) for finding my little-known
blog and suggesting I try them. I don&amp;#8217;t know how much I&amp;#8217;ll be able to
run on this poor system (2.4GHz P-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;III&lt;/span&gt; is the fastest I have, but &lt;span class="caps"&gt;768MB&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;RAM&lt;/span&gt; is a bit weak), but I&amp;#8217;ll do the best I can, and post my&amp;nbsp;results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One comment - I can&amp;#8217;t seem to find a feature list for
&lt;a href="http://www.opennms.org/"&gt;OpenNMS&lt;/a&gt;, so I may be wrong, but it looks like
&lt;a href="http://www.hyperic.com/products/hq_oss.html"&gt;Hyperic &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HQ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; may be in the
lead at the moment, simply because it seems to include built-in asset
tracking with hardware discovery - something that takes me way too long
to manually keep up-to-date. On another side-note, the web site for
&lt;a href="http://www.groundworkopensource.com/products/os-overview.html"&gt;Groundwork Open

leaves a sour taste in my mouth, as it&amp;#8217;s pretty sparse - there&amp;#8217;s a lot

management parts, and front bezels/panels (that I got from &lt;a href="http://www.material.rutgers.edu/surplussales.shtml"&gt;Rutgers
Unversity Surplus&lt;/a&gt;)
to sell on &lt;a href="http://myworld.ebay.com/jason-antman/"&gt;EBay&lt;/a&gt;. So, aside from
expenses (like $45/month for Verizon data service on my wonderful &lt;a href="http://www.palm.com/us/products/smartphones/treo700p/"&gt;Treo
700p&lt;/a&gt;) and
savings, I decided that I should make some infrastructure upgrades to&amp;nbsp;jasonantman.com.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just figuring out what to do was a task. I&amp;#8217;ll admit that my
administration techniques haven&amp;#8217;t really scaled with the network, so I
clicked into my &lt;a href="http://www.nagios.org/"&gt;Nagios&lt;/a&gt; installation, and
remembered that I&amp;#8217;m monitoring 17 hosts (and 165 services), I realized
that this will end up being a big project, both in terms of
infrastructure/hardware and software. The first decision was that I
wouldn&amp;#8217;t do anything with the hosts at the &lt;a href="http://www.midlandparkambulance.com/"&gt;ambulance
corps&lt;/a&gt; or my apartment (the
apartment is all non-mission-critical), so that narrowed it down to the
main seven systems at&amp;nbsp;home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Figuring out what I have running was also a major task, and highlighted
some real problems. I found &lt;a href="http://www.dracoware.com/ppl/rtwomey/inventory.shtml"&gt;a Perl script that gathers hardware
information on Linux-based
systems&lt;/a&gt; from
&lt;a href="http://www.dracoware.com/ppl/rtwomey/index.html"&gt;Ryan Twomey&lt;/a&gt;
(&lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; is running some version of
&lt;a href="http://www.opensuse.org/"&gt;OpenSuSE&lt;/a&gt; 10.x except for the mailserver,
which runs &lt;a href="http://www.sun.com/software/solaris/"&gt;Sun Solaris 10&lt;/a&gt;). I
had to scp the script and its&amp;#8217; two perl modules to five machines (not
counting the one I was working on), &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SSH&lt;/span&gt; into them an run it, and then
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SCP&lt;/span&gt; the results back. Well, that&amp;#8217;s something to worry about later. For
Solaris, I just ran some commands and gathered the information&amp;nbsp;manually.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="the-results"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#the-results"&gt;The&amp;nbsp;Results:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

    Compaq Proliant &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ML370&lt;/span&gt;-G1, 2x 750MHz Pentium-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;III&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;2GB&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RAM&lt;/span&gt;, 4x &lt;span class="caps"&gt;18GB&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SCSI&lt;/span&gt; disks in a 3-disk &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RAID5&lt;/span&gt; with one hot&amp;nbsp;spare.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one unfortunate about these (for me, &amp;#8220;new&amp;#8221;) machines is that they
all have 10/100 Mb/s NICs, so an upgrade to gigabit will mean hardware&amp;nbsp;changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the rest falls somewhere in the middle. One option, if budget is an
issue, is to move an older machine down to the apartment to use as a
print server for &lt;a href="/2007/11/print-accounting.html"&gt;print
accounting&lt;/a&gt;,
which is currently running in a Xen &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VM&lt;/span&gt; as the &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; load on a beautiful
1U Dell PowerEdge 650 (Pentium-4 2.4GHz, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;762MB&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RAM&lt;/span&gt;, 2x &lt;span class="caps"&gt;36GB&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SCSI&lt;/span&gt; disks,
3com 10/100 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NIC&lt;/span&gt; and Intel Pro Dual-Gigabit&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NIC&lt;/span&gt;).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="other-acquisitions-on-the-list"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#other-acquisitions-on-the-list"&gt;Other acquisitions on the&amp;nbsp;list:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New switch to replace the aged BayStack 450-24T
    that &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; is running on now. I&amp;#8217;m looking for something good,
    managed, with Telnet (or &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SSH&lt;/span&gt;) and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SNMP&lt;/span&gt; for monitoring, as well as
    the easy ability to do a span port. The important thing is that I
    *never* have to be on-site to manage it. Maybe a Cisco if I can
    choose a model and get the cash&amp;nbsp;together.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A gigabit (even unmanaged, though &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SNMP&lt;/span&gt; monitoring and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MRTG&lt;/span&gt;/Cacti
    would be nice) switch for a dedicated backup network, to move that
    load off of the little 100Mbps main&amp;nbsp;switch.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Right now, I just have everything &lt;a href="http://www.jasonantman.com/wiki/index.php/Jasonantman.com_Hardware"&gt;crammed onto a Sears metal shop
    shelf
    unit&lt;/a&gt;.
    I&amp;#8217;d really like to replace that with a nice little 24U (low ceilings
    in the basement) rack, especially since most of my stuff is&amp;nbsp;rack-mount.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t have rack rails for any of the Proliants - none of them came
    with them, and they were all purchased before I had anything rack
    mounted (at the&amp;nbsp;apartment).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h1 id="software-needs"&gt;&lt;a class="toclink" href="#software-needs"&gt;Software&amp;nbsp;Needs:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Obviously, some better way of handling administration. Right now,
    software updates (via YaST/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;YOU&lt;/span&gt;) are run as cron jobs, and I have no
    easy way of distributing files or running commands on multiple
    systems without manually scp/ssh&amp;#8217;ing to all of&amp;nbsp;them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;#8217;m going to start testing some other &lt;a href="/2008/01/network-monitoring.html"&gt;Network
    Monitoring&lt;/a&gt;
    packages at the apartment. Since I&amp;#8217;m going to have some scheduled
    downtime for all of this (especially with a router/firewall
    replacement), I might as well plan a move to a new monitoring&amp;nbsp;system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At the moment, all of my web presence is on one Generation-1 (G-I)
    Compaq Proliant server. While it seems to have a lot of life left
    (especially under its&amp;#8217; current low load), I don&amp;#8217;t like that.
    Especially given that I&amp;#8217;m only home every other weekend, so even
    with nightly backups, if it gives up the ghost I&amp;#8217;m down for a while.
    I&amp;#8217;m going to think about mirroring this to a box at the apartment
    (see both items below), but there are still some technical issues to
    be dealt&amp;nbsp;with:  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both home and the apartment are on residential high-bandwidth
        connections (&lt;a href="http://www.verizon.com/fios"&gt;Verizon FiOS&lt;/a&gt; and
        &lt;a href="http://www.optimum.com/"&gt;Optimum Online&lt;/a&gt;, respectively) using
        &lt;a href="http://www.dyndns.org/"&gt;DynDNS.org&lt;/a&gt; with dynamic IPs. I still
        haven&amp;#8217;t been able to get &lt;a href="http://ipcop.org/"&gt;IPcop&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VPN&lt;/span&gt;
        between the two (either with the built-in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VPN&lt;/span&gt; or Zerina). If I
        wanted to mirror to the apartment, it would surely be easier to
        copy everything over a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VPN&lt;/span&gt;, and not worry as much about&amp;nbsp;security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I use DynDNS and &lt;a href="http://www.godaddy.com/"&gt;GoDaddy&lt;/a&gt; (yes, this
    years&amp;#8217; Super Bowl commercial was a letdown) Domain Forwarding.
    As a result, I don&amp;#8217;t have any control over &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DNS&lt;/span&gt; at all, so I&amp;#8217;m
    not quite sure how I&amp;#8217;d do a failover from home to the apartment
    automatically. It would be possible, however, to do the manual
    failover from home to the apartment, just for the downtime, if I
    mirrored the home server to a box at the&amp;nbsp;apartment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I don&amp;#8217;t want to give up my email on my Treo, it is tempting
that Verizon FiOS is now listing &lt;a href="http://www22.verizon.com/content/businessdsl/popups/bdsl+speeds+and+package+features/bdsl+speeds+and+package+features.htm"&gt;a business-class FiOS connection
at 3Mbps down/768Kbps
up&lt;/a&gt;
at $80/month with &lt;em&gt;static &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. We&amp;#8217;re paying $30-40/month now, so
dropping the data plan would cover it. I&amp;#8217;d be getting slightly lower
speed, but there would be so many fewer headaches with a static &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IP&lt;/span&gt;,
not to mention that I could finally get my site on port 80 without
nasty redirection, and get a real mailserver without relaying.
Something to think about&amp;#8230;
4.  At the moment, I&amp;#8217;m using IPcop&amp;#8217;s builtin &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DNS&lt;/span&gt; cache for local &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DNS&lt;/span&gt;.
That means I&amp;#8217;m bound to a simple hostname&amp;lt;-&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;IP&lt;/span&gt; pairing. I&amp;#8217;d really
like a real &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DNS&lt;/span&gt; server, so that I can have both hostnames and
functional names. It would also help with&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;VPN&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest problem with all of this is that I&amp;#8217;m only home 2 weekends a
month, so I&amp;#8217;ll probably have to have everything shipped here (to the
apartment at school), do the installation and configuration here, and
then bring it home and drop it in place (and perform final&amp;nbsp;configuration).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ll keep everyone posted as work&amp;nbsp;progresses.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>eeePC, Solaris, other updates</title><link href="https://blog.jasonantman.com/2008/01/eeepc-solaris-other-updates/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2008-01-27T02:18:00-05:00</published><updated>2008-01-27T02:18:00-05:00</updated><author><name>admin</name></author><id>tag:blog.jasonantman.com,2008-01-27:/2008/01/eeepc-solaris-other-updates/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m trying to get around to updating my blog on a regular basis.

&lt;a href="http://www.stevegarwood.com/"&gt;Steve Garwood&lt;/a&gt;. While I&amp;#8217;m really psyched
about classes - specifically the latter two, which really appeal to
someone technical like me (and also the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MTO&lt;/span&gt; class, as I know I could use
some experience with &amp;#8220;management&amp;#8221; beyond
&lt;a href="http://www.unitedmedia.com/comics/dilbert/"&gt;Dilbert&lt;/a&gt; and my sarcastic
view of workplace dynamics), this brings me to a quite painful
realization. While my two programming classes at the &lt;a href="http://www.cs.rutgers.edu/"&gt;Rutgers &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CS&lt;/span&gt;
Department&lt;/a&gt; met in Linux labs, the usual lab
for classes at &lt;a href="http://www.scils.rutgers.edu/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SCILS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a Windows&amp;nbsp;lab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn&amp;#8217;t just a problem because of moral reasons, but more because of
practical ones - I know Linux. I like it.
&lt;em&gt;I&amp;#8217;m used to Linux.&lt;/em&gt; I do tens of
hours of development and admin work every week (maybe hundreds if I&amp;#8217;m
being bad, or in a prolific period), and I&amp;#8217;m most productive in the
environment I&amp;#8217;m used to. I remember when I took my Java classes, trying
to explain to the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TA&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s that I wasn&amp;#8217;t cheating, but I had to bring a
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CD&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ROM&lt;/span&gt; to the on-computer programming exam -
&lt;strong&gt;&amp;#8220;there&amp;#8217;s no way you can make me
program without my&amp;nbsp;.emacs!&amp;#8221;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve considered that I could just bring my eeePC to class and do
everything on that over wireless. I guess that could work for most of
the class, though I can&amp;#8217;t say how my professors will react to that. In
preparation for an averse reaction, I&amp;#8217;ve looked into how to deal with
using Windows in a way that&amp;#8217;s usable for me. After doing a little
research, I found &lt;a href="http://portableapps.com/"&gt;PortableApps.com&lt;/a&gt; which
provides versions of &lt;a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/"&gt;Firefox&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/thunderbird/"&gt;Thunderbird&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href="http://www.openoffice.org/"&gt;OpenOffice&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href="http://www.pidgin.im/"&gt;Pidgin&lt;/a&gt;, and other apps (even including
&lt;a href="http://winscp.net/eng/index.php"&gt;WinSCP&lt;/a&gt;, a Windows &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SCP&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SFTP&lt;/span&gt; client) as
Windows executables that will run entirely from a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USB&lt;/span&gt; flash drive. Most
importantly, I even found &lt;a href="http://pigpog.com/node/2875"&gt;instructions&lt;/a&gt;
(and also
&lt;a href="http://theblackdragon.wordpress.com/2006/05/12/portable-emacs/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;)
to run the Windows version of &lt;a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GNU&lt;/span&gt;
Emacs&lt;/a&gt; from a flash drive. Granted,
I always preferred the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CLI&lt;/span&gt; version of Emacs over the graphical one, but
I guess it&amp;#8217;s a small price to pay. So, once I can find a working &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USB&lt;/span&gt;
flash drive (or an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SD&lt;/span&gt; card to use with an adapter), I&amp;#8217;ll setup what I
need to be able to&amp;nbsp;work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One side note - on the first day of my Management of Technological
Organizations class (painfully meeting 9:50-12:50 Friday mornings) the
professor announced that we&amp;#8217;ll be using Microsoft Excel, Access,
Project, etc. After class I spoke with the lecturer, &lt;a href="http://www.scils.rutgers.edu/directory/rutsmith/index.html"&gt;Cathy
Smith&lt;/a&gt;, and
explained the situation (that I can&amp;#8217;t use those) and asked whether other
software that did the same thing would be acceptable. Amazingly, not
only did she tell me that&amp;#8217;s ok, but she also said that she&amp;#8217;s a big fan
of OpenOffice, and went so far as to say that in place of Access, she&amp;#8217;d
be happy to accept &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SQL&lt;/span&gt; files. Maybe it&amp;#8217;s because she&amp;#8217;s a doctoral
candidate and not a Ph. D. full professor, but I was very happy to find
such enlightenment at Rutgers (for the first&amp;nbsp;time).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On one side note - one of the classes that I had thought of registering
for distributed the syllabus as a .docx &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MS&lt;/span&gt; Office &lt;span class="caps"&gt;XML&lt;/span&gt; file. I was
dumbfounded. I know that few professors take the time to think that some
students may be using Linux or Unix, but do they really think that
everyone&amp;#8217;s already upgraded to Word 2007? I know most professors - even
in an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IT&lt;/span&gt; program - probably don&amp;#8217;t know about the &lt;a href="http://www.noooxml.org/start"&gt;flaws with
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;OOXML&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or the current issues surrounding
it, but I thought that the old .doc was pretty well established as the
default document format in the Windows world. More importantly&amp;#8230; do
these people know nothing about standards and best practices and
cross-platform usability? If I were distributing a static document, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PDF&lt;/span&gt;
is the first thing that would pop into my&amp;nbsp;mind&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a side note, a few links for the day:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="http://royal.pingdom.com/?p=240"&gt;Photos of great data center cabling, almost
art&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;

production. I finally setup my Sun Blade 150 running Solaris 10 as my
new mailserver, replacing a (!!!) vintage 1998 Gateway Pentium &lt;span class="caps"&gt;II&lt;/span&gt; 350MHz
desktop. Quite an upgrade, even to the still-not-new Sun workstation.
Maybe sometime in the future I&amp;#8217;ll even upgrade some of my other old
desktops with my spare Dell PowerEdge&amp;nbsp;2550.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the whole process, from fresh Solaris install to working
mailserver, probably took me around 24 work hours. That being said, I&amp;#8217;ve
never really administered Solaris before, so that also included horribly
long stretches of doc reading and figuring out &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SMF&lt;/span&gt;, package and service
administration,&amp;nbsp;etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve detailed the entire process on my
&lt;a href="http://www.jasonantman.com/wiki/index.php/Solaris_Mailserver"&gt;wiki&lt;/a&gt; in
excruciating detail. The Solaris package repository any pkg-get systems
from &lt;a href="http://www.blastwave.org/"&gt;blastwave.org&lt;/a&gt; were immensely helpful,
as were a number of &lt;a href="http://cuddletech.com/blog/"&gt;Ben Rockwood&amp;#8217;s&lt;/a&gt; blog
posts. The entire operation involved installing and configuring Dovecot
with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IMAPS&lt;/span&gt;, Postfix with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TLS&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SASL&lt;/span&gt; to authenticate to my &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISP&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s
mailserver (which I use to relay outgoing mail, given my dynamic &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IP&lt;/span&gt;),
Procmail, Fetchmail and SpamAssassin. I also had to setup the machine to
relay mail for other hosts on the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LAN&lt;/span&gt;. Rounding it out, I setup
monitoring with Nagios and backups of the system and mail through
Bacula. During the process, I also had to modify some Service Management
Facility (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SMF&lt;/span&gt;) manifests for Fetchmail, Postfix, and&amp;nbsp;Dovecot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still have a few things to do - namely create
&lt;a href="http://www.nagios.org/"&gt;Nagios&lt;/a&gt; check scripts for processors,
temperatures, and fans (using the prtdiag command) and hard drive
status/errors (using iostat -Exn, given that I haven&amp;#8217;t been able to find
a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SMART&lt;/span&gt; tool that supports &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IDE&lt;/span&gt; under Solaris). For everything else, I
just checked the &lt;a href="http://www.nagios-exchange.org/"&gt;NagiosExchange&lt;/a&gt;
plugin repository, using check_by_ssh for everything. The only problem
I had was that NagiosExchange didn&amp;#8217;t appear to have working default
Nagios plugins for Solaris 10. Luckily, though, Blastwave had a
&amp;#8220;nagiosp&amp;#8221; plugin&amp;nbsp;package.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ll probably update this blog with my check plugins as I develop them,
but for now I have a little
&lt;a href="http://www.jasonantman.com/wiki/index.php/Solaris_Nagios_Checks"&gt;page&lt;/a&gt;
on my &lt;a href="http://www.jasonantman.com/wiki/"&gt;wiki&lt;/a&gt;about using Nagios with&amp;nbsp;Solaris.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, I uploaded &lt;a href="http://www.jasonantman.com/wiki/index.php/Jasonantman.com_Hardware"&gt;a few
photos&lt;/a&gt;
of the equipment that runs this blog and the rest of my site and
development network - all on a &amp;#8220;beautiful&amp;#8221; Sears shop shelf in my
basement. Nothing wonderful, but it gets the job done. I&amp;#8217;ll admit that I
could have done a better job stitching the photos together, but the
space is so tight that I can&amp;#8217;t get a wide shot of the whole&amp;nbsp;rack.&lt;/p&gt;

the first one I&amp;#8217;m working with, has a 650MHz Sparc IIi, 512 Mb &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RAM&lt;/span&gt;, and
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;XXXXX&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HDD&lt;/span&gt;. I&amp;#8217;ll figure out the specs on the second when I get it&amp;nbsp;running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also both use simple &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EIDE&lt;/span&gt; drives, so I might put a new drive in,
after checking drive current drive information through &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SMART&lt;/span&gt;. I planned
on using one of the machines (probably this first one, the 650MHz with
the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DVD&lt;/span&gt;) to replace my aging mailserver at home (a 350MHz Pentium &lt;span class="caps"&gt;II&lt;/span&gt;
Gateway desktop), running Solaris 10. The other one will be a
workstation/desktop for me, which will probably run either Solaris 10 or
Solaris Express Developer Edition&amp;nbsp;(&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SXDE&lt;/span&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the project seems to have hit a dead-end. Both systems
have hardware/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NVRAM&lt;/span&gt; security setup, so they won&amp;#8217;t boot from &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CD&lt;/span&gt; without a
password. They also won&amp;#8217;t boot the existing Solaris installation, as
it&amp;#8217;s looking for a whole bunch of network services that don&amp;#8217;t exist. I
found a few suggestions online on how to bypass this, but none of them
worked. So, at this point, I have a few options to&amp;nbsp;consider:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hope that as a Sun Microsystems Campus Ambassador, I can contact
    someone who can advise me on how to clear out the password or&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NVRAM&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hope that as a Rutgers employee, I can track down someone on the
    Camden campus where these came from that may have the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NVRAM&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;password.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Break down and pay $40 each for *new* &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NVRAM&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;chips.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;ll see what the next few days brings. Hopefully not resorting to a
solution that costs more than I paid for the&amp;nbsp;machines.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="sunblade sun solaris opensolaris install firmware boot"></category></entry><entry><title>Tech - Updates</title><link href="https://blog.jasonantman.com/2007/12/tech-updates/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2007-12-11T15:54:00-05:00</published><updated>2007-12-11T15:54:00-05:00</updated><author><name>admin</name></author><id>tag:blog.jasonantman.com,2007-12-11:/2007/12/tech-updates/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;First of all, until I decide on either splitting my blog, or setting up

&lt;p&gt;So I have a few days of sanity - the last week of classes - before exam
time. Hopefully I&amp;#8217;ll wrap some things up, and even finish my Christmas
shopping (&lt;a href="http://www.thinkgeek.com"&gt;ThinkGeek&lt;/a&gt; will be happy&amp;#8230;). I
don&amp;#8217;t have a whole lot of real value to say, but a few notes on upcoming&amp;nbsp;projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;#8217;m going to be buying a few SunBlade 100s and 150s as surplus from
    Rutgers. I&amp;#8217;m probably going to have one or two running at home
    replacing my ancient mail server. I might also bring my PowerEdge
    2550 home to virtualize a few of my machines - though, arguably, my
    two backup machines are the best candidates, though I don&amp;#8217;t like the
    idea of virtualizing&amp;nbsp;backups.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I think the new mail server will run Solaris, though I haven&amp;#8217;t
    looked into the technicalities of
    Procmail/Postfix/SpamAssassin/some-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;IMAP&lt;/span&gt;-server on&amp;nbsp;Solaris.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="/2007/11/print-accounting.html"&gt;Print
    Accounting&lt;/a&gt;
    is finished, though the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GUI&lt;/span&gt; isn&amp;#8217;t completely done. I&amp;#8217;ll have it in
    &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CVS&lt;/span&gt; sometime this&amp;nbsp;week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m thinking about password managers. I posted a comment to the
&lt;a href="http://www.sage.org/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SAGE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; mailing list, but didn&amp;#8217;t get many helpful
replies. I&amp;#8217;m looking for a solution that can keep track of all of my
usernames and passwords. It needs to be secure. Very secure. I&amp;#8217;d like to
set separate passwords for almost every machine/account that I have.
More importantly, I want something easily portable. Unfortunately, I
find things like the
&lt;a href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/gadgets/security/91a2/"&gt;Mandylion&lt;/a&gt; a bit
limiting - not only does the device generate passwords for you, so you
can&amp;#8217;t really store many notes (I might want to keep track of a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt;, name
for the entry, username, member number, etc.) but it&amp;#8217;s also a single
hardware device - no way to back it up, and easy to lose. I also saw the
&lt;a href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/gadgets/security/99f1/"&gt;IronKey&lt;/a&gt; which sounds
damn good - especially the Mission Impossible-esque self-destructing
encryption chip. But that means that some @$$ just has to type in 10
incorrect passwords and it&amp;#8217;s useless. Moreover, it needs to be plugged
into a system, so if I don&amp;#8217;t have a laptop and I&amp;#8217;m not at a trusted
terminal, there&amp;#8217;s ample security&amp;nbsp;risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I talked to my roommate (an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EE&lt;/span&gt; major) about hardware solutions, but they
seem to be a bit expensive and way too much R&amp;amp;D time. So, it seems like
the only real solution is software. At the moment, what I have to work
with includes a &lt;a href="http://maemo.org/community/wiki/nokia_770_hardware_specification/"&gt;Nokia 770 Internet
Tablet&lt;/a&gt;,
a Blackberry 7250 (hopefully being replaced by a Treo 650p or 700p
soon), an array of Linux desktops, and my laptop (right now a Linux box
that stays on my desk, but maybe a MacBook, iBook, or &lt;a href="http://eeepc.asus.com/"&gt;Asus
eeePC&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;soon).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The overall idea is to create a set (or trio, or quartet) of
applications to act as a password manager. They would store passwords
and related information (initial acitvation date, reset date, scheduled
reset date, username, system/site name, notes) in a flat file or a
simple database like
&lt;a href="http://www.oracle.com/technology/products/berkeley-db/index.html"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;BDB&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.
That file would then be encrypted using GNUpg and strong encryption.
Another possibility is separate files per &amp;#8220;class&amp;#8221; of password, such as
one for root accounts, one for user accounts, one for web sites, etc.
with different encryption strength for each class (speed may be an issue
for en/decrypting large files on small devices like&amp;nbsp;phones).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of the program, ideally I&amp;#8217;d have a graphical client for my
phone (Treo or Blackberry) probably written in Java, a graphical client
for the Nokia 770 (maybe Java, maybe something using Python and native
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GTK&lt;/span&gt;), a graphical client for my laptop, and a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CLI&lt;/span&gt; client for the 770 and
laptop. Databases would have to be sync&amp;#8217;ed across machines - the 770 is
easy enough to just find the newest file and copy it, or manually
decrypt, diff, and then encrypt. I don&amp;#8217;t know how I&amp;#8217;d do it on the
phones, the only thing I can think of right now is to pay for data
usage, and then manually copy over to the phone (either via &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SFTP&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SCP&lt;/span&gt;,
or a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTTPS&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;connection).&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="passwords"></category></entry><entry><title>Print Accounting</title><link href="https://blog.jasonantman.com/2007/11/print-accounting/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2007-11-27T00:51:00-05:00</published><updated>2007-11-27T00:51:00-05:00</updated><author><name>admin</name></author><id>tag:blog.jasonantman.com,2007-11-27:/2007/11/print-accounting/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Since we moved into our apartment at the end of last summer, my

roommates and I have had a Brother &lt;span class="caps"&gt;5170DN&lt;/span&gt; monochrome laser in the
hallway as a communal printer. Last weekend, two new printers arrived -
I got a Xerox DocuPrint N4525 - a big surplus student lab printer that
handles paper up to 11x17&amp;#8221; and print rates of up to 45 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PPM&lt;/span&gt;. My roommates
picked up a (free!) &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HP&lt;/span&gt; Color LaserJet 4500. So, I decided that I want
accounting of who prints what on each&amp;nbsp;printer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I setup a Dell PowerEdge 650 running openSuSE 10.3, Xen and 2 NICs, one
on our main network and one with a static &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IP&lt;/span&gt; in a separate subnet hooked
up to a small 5-port switch. I setup a Xen &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VM&lt;/span&gt; (also openSuSE 10.3) to
act as a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CUPS&lt;/span&gt; server. I then installed
&lt;a href="http://www.pykota.com/software/tea4cups"&gt;tea4cups&lt;/a&gt; which allows
outgoing &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CUPS&lt;/span&gt; jobs to be read via a pseudo-backend while they&amp;#8217;re
processing. tea4cups calls some &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt; scripts that update a MySQL database
with job information, including page counts and ink coverage amounts
calculated by &lt;a href="http://www.pykota.com/software/pkpgcounter"&gt;pkpgcounter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is all done with a kludge of custom scripts, which I&amp;#8217;ll put in my
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CVS&lt;/span&gt; repo (and comment on here) sometime this&amp;nbsp;week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did run into two problems. First, I had issues with getting tea4cups
to run at all. After googling a bit, I read about people having problems
with tea4cups and SELinux. Sure enough, I disabled AppArmor and all went
back to normal. Also, I later had some problems trying to perform ink
accounting on a color printer. After some investigation, I also found
out that GhostScript 8.15 is buggy and will cause problems with
pkpgcounter. I upgraded to the 8.60 RPMs and all was&amp;nbsp;well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole project is still in the works, but when finished I should have
a system that will keep track of all printing in the apartment by
username and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IP&lt;/span&gt;, and track the page count, paper size, color or B&amp;amp;W,
resolution, and ink coverage percentage (both for grayscale and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CMYK&lt;/span&gt; or
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;RGB&lt;/span&gt; individually). I know it&amp;#8217;s overkill - all I want to really know is
enough data to fairly split the costs of paper, toner, etc. - but I
thought it would be a fun&amp;nbsp;project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I originally thought about using
&lt;a href="http://www.pykota.com/software/pykota"&gt;PyKota&lt;/a&gt; for the accounting, but
found it to be way too heavy-weight. My current kludge, done up in one
night (before writing an essay), is based on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CUPS&lt;/span&gt; and tea4cups, which
calls &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt; backend prehooks and posthooks, which in turn make use of a
few pre-written python and perl scripts that deal with querying
information from the printer (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;IPP&lt;/span&gt;) and local&amp;nbsp;files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, for something that didn&amp;#8217;t exist 24 hours ago, I think it&amp;#8217;s
working pretty well so&amp;nbsp;far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 2015-02-11:&lt;/strong&gt; Someone (comments below) has found this and asked
for further information. Sadly, I wrote this stuff eight years ago, and
haven&amp;#8217;t been running it in seven or so. I &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; manage to find the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CVS&lt;/span&gt;
repository in my backups, so I have some of the code. It&amp;#8217;s certainly not
functional or documented, but it should give you at least a general idea
of how all this fits together. Be aware that there &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; some known issues,
so I wouldn&amp;#8217;t consider the data it gives (at least when it comes to ink
usage) as more than a rough estimate. The original idea was to do print
accounting for my roommates and I (being good geeks we had three printers
including a color laser - a bit of a novelty at the time - and an 11x17&amp;#8221;
laser) so we could evenly split the bill when it came time to buy toner.
The accounting code is &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt;, and really bad &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt; at that. There&amp;#8217;s a
a web interface, but unfortunately the database schema is long gone.
I have no idea what versions of packages this was written for, but assume
they could have been &amp;#8220;old&amp;#8221; versions in 2007. All that being said, assuming
that tea4cups hasn&amp;#8217;t changed too much since then, this should give you
at least a general idea of how this all fit together and is&amp;nbsp;possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code that I have is available as a 35K .tar.gz archive &lt;a href="/GFX/printAccounting.tar.gz"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>New Project, Thoughts on Development</title><link href="https://blog.jasonantman.com/2007/11/new-project-thoughts-on-development/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2007-11-19T23:49:00-05:00</published><updated>2007-11-19T23:49:00-05:00</updated><author><name>admin</name></author><id>tag:blog.jasonantman.com,2007-11-19:/2007/11/new-project-thoughts-on-development/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I know I don&amp;#8217;t update anywhere near often enough - then again, I update

a lot more here than I do on my Sun blog. But I&amp;#8217;ll do better, I promise
- and I&amp;#8217;ll setup a new template, too. Maybe&amp;nbsp;tonight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I was just thinking about my software development - about how many
projects that I never finished, or never even started. And it got me
thinking. When Rutgers laid off all of us part-time programmers and I
was given a few choices for a new job, I chose tech support for student
labs and classroom connectivity. Why? Obviously I&amp;#8217;m not going to learn
much. But I like putting out fires. I like solving problems. More
importantly, and more of an issue when I try to write software, I like
meeting a list of minimum requirements and just doing that. I love
solving problems and I love making things work. On the other hand, at
least when it comes to open-source (and no-cost/no-pay) projects, I have
serious problems with motivation. Or, should I say, I get a project to
do what I need, and I abandon&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess I should print some sort of warning on my project pages. Or, I
should be happy that F/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;OSS&lt;/span&gt; is getting as popular as it is. Even among
people who don&amp;#8217;t know what it&amp;#8217;s about. I&amp;#8217;ve been getting endless emails
about my &lt;a href="http://www.php-ems-tools.com"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EMS&lt;/span&gt; Tools.&lt;/a&gt; I&amp;#8217;ve marked it
as beta. The readme and the extensive docs make it clear that it&amp;#8217;s not a
finished work that&amp;#8217;s suitable for everyone. I make it clear that I don&amp;#8217;t
do tech support for Windows, as I know nothing about it. Yet, it seems
that finding a project on SourceForge or Google is wonderfully easy, yet
it&amp;#8217;s easier to just e-mail the developer than take the time to read the
docs. I mus say, though, that when I download something on SourceForge,
especially something that isn&amp;#8217;t marked with a complete/stable status, I
fully expect to spend a few hours playing with the source before getting
it up and&amp;nbsp;running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I don&amp;#8217;t look at my lack of follow-through as a horrible thing. I
have a problem. There&amp;#8217;s nothing else out there that even begins to solve
it. So, I write something that solves my problem. The next time someone
has the problem, they can use my code. If I didn&amp;#8217;t carry it far enough,
they can pick up where I left off. When they get it where they want it,
they can send their changes back to&amp;nbsp;me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lately, I&amp;#8217;ve been reading a great book - &amp;#8220;&lt;a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?z=y&amp;amp;EAN=9780141000510&amp;amp;itm=1"&gt;Hackers: Heros of the
Computer
Revolution&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8221;
by Steven Levy. There&amp;#8217;s some really great reading about the good &amp;#8216;ol
days at the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MIT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AI&lt;/span&gt; lab, and the Homebrew Computer Club and the
beginnings of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PC&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s (the Altair). And there&amp;#8217;s a lot of commentary about
&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_ethic"&gt;The Hacker Ethic&lt;/a&gt; - a
definite forerunner to the Free Software/Open Source movement. Most
specifically, the idea of software belonging to the people, of source
code being open and freely distributed for the good of everyone. And it
really gets me thinking. People sometimes ask me why I don&amp;#8217;t sell the
software I write. Why should I? I&amp;#8217;m not writing it for a client, I&amp;#8217;m not
getting paid to write it. I&amp;#8217;m writing it for me. It seems *wrong* not
to let others benefit from my work. And even if I was writing it for a
client, why not give it away to others? Many people might not, but I&amp;#8217;d
give paying clients a break if they agreed to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPL&lt;/span&gt; the&amp;nbsp;code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, for a while I&amp;#8217;ve been trying to find software that will run on
Linux to draw network maps. The networks at my house and apartment have
gotten complex enough that it&amp;#8217;s hard to hold everything in my mind. I
made an attempt to draw a map in Dia and Kivio, but they just didn&amp;#8217;t cut
it - all of that manual updating. So I wrote a little &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt; script that
uses Imagick (the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt; wrapper to ImageMagick) to generate network maps.
It takes a simple &lt;span class="caps"&gt;XML&lt;/span&gt; files, one per host, to define devices and
connections. It outputs a nice &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PNG&lt;/span&gt; map, defaulting to 800x800 pixels,
but can be scaled up large enough to print on a 36&amp;#8221; wide plotter. Code
can be accessed through &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CVS&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a href="http://cvs.jasonantman.com/cgi-bin/viewvc.cgi/cvs/misc-scripts/networkMap/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
It&amp;#8217;s not an official release so the docs aren&amp;#8217;t complete, but there are
ample comments in the code and sample config files. Most importantly,
it&amp;#8217;s all wraped up in one &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt; function, so generating a map (once you&amp;#8217;ve
generated &lt;span class="caps"&gt;XML&lt;/span&gt; config files) is as simple as including a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt; file and
calling one&amp;nbsp;function.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry></feed>
