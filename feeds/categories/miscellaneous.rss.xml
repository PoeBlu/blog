static site generator, hosted on &lt;a href="http://pages.github.com/"&gt;GitHub Pages&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;#8217;s not only easier and free, but also the
first step in my plan to migrate off of my &lt;a href="http://linode.com"&gt;Linode&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VM&lt;/span&gt; and onto a mix of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EC2&lt;/span&gt; and free&amp;nbsp;services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m sure this post will be &lt;a href="/2009/02/wordpress-installation-finished/"&gt;around in five years&lt;/a&gt; when there&amp;#8217;s a smarter way
to do all this, but until then&amp;#8230;&amp;nbsp;yay!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hit a number of bumps during the migration, mainly around &lt;a href="/2014/02/converting-wordpress-posts-to-pelican-markdown/"&gt;Migrating &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt; posts from WordPress to Markdown in Pelican&lt;/a&gt;
and migrating &lt;a href="/2014/03/wordpress-to-pelican-with-disqus-comments/"&gt;WordPress comments to Disqus&lt;/a&gt;, but in the end everything
seems to be working. Hopefully someone will find this and save a few hours or days of work if they try the same&amp;nbsp;thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Post-go-live I still had some issues - Disqus was displaying an&amp;nbsp;error:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were unable to load Disqus. If you are a moderator please see our troubleshooting&amp;nbsp;guide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;on all posts created after the WordPress migration, and FeedBurner rejected my attempts to change the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RSS&lt;/span&gt; feed &lt;span class="caps"&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt; to
its new value (though I&amp;#8217;m pretty sure that&amp;#8217;s because I neglected to drop the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TTL&lt;/span&gt; on the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DNS&lt;/span&gt; record, and I can&amp;#8217;t
find a way to tell Feedburner to purge it from&amp;nbsp;cache).&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Jason Antman</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 01 Mar 2014 14:14:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>tag:blog.jasonantman.com,2014-03-01:2014/03/blog-moved-from-self-hosted-wordpress-to-pelican-on-github-pages/</guid><category>blog</category><category>wordpress</category><category>pelican</category><category>github</category></item><item><title>Planning Migration from WordPress to Static Site</title><link>http://blog.jasonantman.com/2014/01/planning-migration-from-wordpress-to-static-site/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Right now, this blog, my email, and a whole bunch of other services are
hosted on a &lt;a href="http://linode.com"&gt;Linode&lt;/a&gt; Xen &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VM&lt;/span&gt;. I don&amp;#8217;t really keep up
to date with administration and upgrades the way I used to, and
honestly, I&amp;#8217;d rather spend my time working on other things (like
actually writing all of the blog posts that I&amp;#8217;ve been planning to. The
first thing I&amp;#8217;ve identified for migration is this blog itself. It&amp;#8217;s
currently on WordPress and, frankly, I don&amp;#8217;t either need nor like it.
But there are some features I like. I&amp;#8217;d like to end up with a static
site generator, hosted from either S3 or GitHub Pages. I know that means
I&amp;#8217;ll lost comments (unless I move to a third-party, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JS&lt;/span&gt;-based comment
system like &lt;a href="http://disqus.com/"&gt;Disqus&lt;/a&gt;, which means I&amp;#8217;ll lose
&lt;em&gt;control&lt;/em&gt; over my comments) but I suppose I can live with that. What I
really want is something simple, static, cheap or free (that I&amp;#8217;ll likely
put behind a small ec2 instance running nginx for&amp;nbsp;redirects/rewrites).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m still in the planning phase, and trying to come up with a
feature-by-feature comparison of my options. I&amp;#8217;ll likely post that when
I finally have it done (at the moment it&amp;#8217;s in a very rough &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AnHh-ye5DNiNdF9DWkJrT2kzSkNsNVp6cjMzLXJ6VEE&amp;amp;usp=sharing"&gt;Google Docs
spreadsheet&lt;/a&gt;).
I&amp;#8217;m trying to round up my static site generator options and see which
ones will do most, if not all, of what I want (though I still haven&amp;#8217;t
discounted using hosted wordpress if it comes down to it). Here are the
features I currently &amp;#8220;use&amp;#8221; (have) on my WordPress&amp;nbsp;blog:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;User-defined permalinks to&amp;nbsp;posts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Overall &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RSS&lt;/span&gt; feed of blog (currently powered by FeedBurner) and of&amp;nbsp;comments)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Categories (a post can be in multiple&amp;nbsp;categories)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tags&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Category and Tag&amp;nbsp;pages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;per-Category and per-Tag feeds&amp;nbsp;(&lt;span class="caps"&gt;RSS&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tag cloud &amp;#8220;widget&amp;#8221; in&amp;nbsp;sidebar&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Themes. I actually like my current &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WP&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;theme&amp;#8230;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Visitor statistics (currently self-hosted
    &lt;a href="http://piwik.org/"&gt;Piwik&lt;/a&gt;, formerly Google&amp;nbsp;Analytics)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Post publishing via cron&amp;#8217;ed script (&lt;em&gt;see below&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Draft/Pending status (i.e. let me save a partial post, and let me
    save a complete post but mark it &amp;#8220;pending&amp;#8221; so I can just publish it&amp;nbsp;later)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Commenting (this will probably be the big sticking&amp;nbsp;point)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Syntax&amp;nbsp;hilighting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As &amp;#8220;weird&amp;#8221; as this is, I write all my posts in raw &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt;, and am
    perfectly happy doing&amp;nbsp;that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Subscribe via Email&amp;#8221; FeedBurner&amp;nbsp;widget&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;XML&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;Sitemap&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Twitter&amp;nbsp;box/widget&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pingbacks (not that these are really useful for anything other than
    spam these&amp;nbsp;days)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Automatic or manual post excerpts for feeds,&amp;nbsp;etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remote publishing via &lt;span class="caps"&gt;XML&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;RPC&lt;/span&gt;/Android app (not that I&amp;#8217;ve used it
    more than once or&amp;nbsp;twice)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Advertising - I currently use Google AdSense on my blog. The revenue
    from my tiny hit count isn&amp;#8217;t enough to offset the cost of a Linode,
    but if I moved to a much less expensive hosting service, it might be
    worth considering (you can&amp;#8217;t run ads on the free hosted WordPress,
    and I doubt you can on GitHub Pages&amp;nbsp;either).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should be updating this post when I do some more research and have a
comparison of the&amp;nbsp;options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note on &amp;#8220;Post publishing via cron&amp;#8217;ed script&amp;#8221; - sometimes I sit down and
write half a dozen or so blog posts at a time. But I don&amp;#8217;t want them all
to show up immediately, and spam the few people who still use &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RSS&lt;/span&gt;
readers after the death of Google Reader. So I set the posts to
&amp;#8220;Pending&amp;#8221; status, and I have a cron&amp;#8217;ed script that runs every weekday
morning and publishes the one oldest &amp;#8220;pending&amp;#8221; post. Who knows if this
actually does any good or&amp;nbsp;not&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">admin</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2014 15:15:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>tag:blog.jasonantman.com,2014-01-01:2014/01/planning-migration-from-wordpress-to-static-site/</guid><category>blog</category><category>jekyll</category><category>pelican</category><category>python</category><category>static site</category><category>wordpress</category></item><item><title>Random Links for Wednesday, October 24th</title><link>http://blog.jasonantman.com/2012/10/random-links-for-wednesday-october-24th/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Some random interesting links from Slashdot for&amp;nbsp;today:&lt;/p&gt;

Limoncelli&amp;#8217;s
blog&lt;/a&gt;.
It&amp;#8217;s a 1953 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; Navy instructional video about an all-mechanical fire
control computer. Yes, I really mean a &lt;em&gt;computer&lt;/em&gt; that can solve
continuously changing 25-variable fire control problems using only
mechanical means (gears, cams, etc.). Think about it for a minute - it&amp;#8217;s
truly mind-boggling. And really gives one an amazing appreciation for
the power of a simple pocket calculator, and the amazing engineering
that went into solving these problems before electronic computers. I&amp;#8217;m
usually not much of a math geek, but I watched the whole 40 minute video
and was in awe of both the simple ability to use three arms and a pin to
multiply numbers, and the amazingly precise engineering and machining it
would take to translate various rotation inputs into landing a shell on
a moving ship miles away. It&amp;#8217;s a really good watch, and will probably
leave you astonished by both how far technology has come (and what we
take for granted every day), and by the fact that feats of engineering
like this one worked quite&amp;nbsp;well.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">admin</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 12 Oct 2012 20:54:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:blog.jasonantman.com,2012-10-12:2012/10/all-mechanical-computer-instructional-video/</guid><category>mechanical computer</category></item><item><title>New Job</title><link>http://blog.jasonantman.com/2012/09/new-job/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Today is my last day in my almost-year-long stint as a System

&lt;a href="/2012/03/new-blog-theme/"&gt;posted&lt;/a&gt; that I was looking into open source
self-hosted web analytics tools to replace &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/"&gt;Google
Analytics&lt;/a&gt;. There were a few reasons
for this; most importantly, it started from a discussion with some
privacy-conscious coworkers, who said that they use
&lt;a href="http://noscript.net/"&gt;NoScript&lt;/a&gt; and specifically block Google from
tracking them (which also breaks Google Analytics). This was a serious
issue for me, as I no longer process server-side logs but relied solely
on Google Analytics for traffic information. So, I decided to try
something other than Google and ended up settling on
&lt;a href="http://piwik.org/"&gt;Piwik&lt;/a&gt; as my solution. I will say, in full
disclosure, that the amount of information Piwki gives is a bit scary; I
can watch users navigate this blog in realtime, and even the initial
dashboard page gives a list of the most recent visitors, with their &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IP&lt;/span&gt;
address, country of origin, browser, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OS&lt;/span&gt;, and the pages they visited.
However my decision was made on two main points: first, that I wanted
something withich could use server-side &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt; to log visits (albeit with a
lot less information) of people who had JavaScript or tracking disabled,
and second, that if &lt;em&gt;someone&lt;/em&gt; is going to have such amazingly detailed
information on my visitors, it should be me, so I can ensure that I&amp;#8217;m
the only person who has access to it and that it isn&amp;#8217;t used for the
wrong&amp;nbsp;purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside: The only revenue I get from this site is through &lt;a href=""&gt;Google
AdSense&lt;/a&gt;, which isn&amp;#8217;t a whole lot given the low traffic (certainly
not enough to pay for the hosting). Other than that, I keep this blog
to try and share my knowledge with others, and hope that someone else
can find the solution to their problem here instead of doing the work
that I did. So, I find analytics very helpful; I check my stats now
and then, go back and update or add to the most popular posts, and try
to write relevant posts if it seems like a lot of people are finding
their way here for something slightly different than the actual post
they landed on. Unfortunately, that last point isn&amp;#8217;t as easy since
&lt;a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2011/10/making-search-more-secure.html"&gt;Google switched to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTTPS&lt;/span&gt; Search for logged-in users on October 18th,
2011&lt;/a&gt;
- I can no longer use Piwik see the search keywords that got Google
users to my site. Luckily, these are still available through &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/"&gt;Google
Webmaster Tools&lt;/a&gt; (via
Traffic -&gt; Search Queries on the left menu), though it adds an
additional step and removes some of my motivation to check regularly
and make sure people are getting useful content. Also, perhaps most
importantly, it doesn&amp;#8217;t let me associate search query with other stats
like time on page, so even if one search query was very popular, I
have no way of knowing whether all those people actually read the
page, or took one look at it and&amp;nbsp;left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really like Piwki. I don&amp;#8217;t use most of it terribly often, but it gives
me a nice overview visits graph on the WordPress dashboard (via the
&lt;a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-piwik/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;WP&lt;/span&gt;-Piwik&lt;/a&gt; plugin),
infinitely detailed information (most of which I haven&amp;#8217;t even looked at)
in the Piwki web interface, and nightly email reports of visits to the
site. It also supports multiple sites, so I have it on my ancient
&lt;a href="http://wiki.jasonantman.com"&gt;wiki&lt;/a&gt;, my
&lt;a href="http://redmine.jasonantman.com"&gt;Redmine&lt;/a&gt; instance, and even
&lt;a href="/2012/03/adding-piwik-web-analytics-integration-to-viewvc/"&gt;ViewVC&lt;/a&gt;.
I&amp;#8217;d highly recommend it; it&amp;#8217;s full-featured (beyond anything I can even
comprehend,&amp;nbsp;really)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was recently looking through the stats for this blog, and came by some
unfortunate, though not surprising, trends. Below is the graph of visits
per day, from April 1, 2012 through today (August 26,&amp;nbsp;2012):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="blog visits chart" src="/GFX/blog_visits.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;#8217;s probably not terribly unusual for a site with as much technical
    content as mine (and mostly professional stuff, not just for
    hobbyists), my weekend traffic is usually a full 50% lower than
    weekday traffic. This can also be seen in the graph of visits by
    visitor&amp;#8217;s local time, which is decidedly biased towards the 9am-5pm
    window:&lt;br /&gt;

    time" src="/GFX/blog_visits_localtime.png" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
    I guess there&amp;#8217;s nothing I can really do about that, and it just
    gives me a nice maintenance window at 4am on Sunday mornings&amp;nbsp;:)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Looking at the overall graph, there also appears to be quite a bit
    of oscillation of the average visits over time. It&amp;#8217;s nothing
    terribly large, but at a guess, I&amp;#8217;d attribute it to my sporadic&amp;nbsp;posting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Though it&amp;#8217;s not visible in these graphs, this site has an 80% bounce
    rate (the percent of visitors that viewed only one page and then
    left the site). I guess that&amp;#8217;s also not terribly unusual for a site
    with mostly how-to information on a wide variety of&amp;nbsp;topics.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To add a little more information to some of the previous items, here
    is the chart of my &lt;a href="http://feedburner.google.com"&gt;Feedburner&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RSS&lt;/span&gt;/Atom feed, since I started using Feedburner in February. The
    number of subscribers is in green, and the reach (number of people
    who actually clicked through to a post) is in blue:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img alt="Feedburner stats" src="/GFX/feedburner_stats.png" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
    This is a clear indication of something even stronger than the
    &amp;#8220;bounce rate&amp;#8221;; the apparently high number of people who subscribe to
    and then unsubscribe from my feed (if these stats are accurate). To
    me, this is an even stronger indication that what I really need to
    do is post useful content on a more regular basis - I have a
    tendency to blog in spurts, and either start a draft and never
    finish it, or write a few posts and set them to &amp;#8220;pending&amp;#8221; status
    with the intent of publishing them over a few days&amp;#8230; and then
    forget the last&amp;nbsp;part.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;a &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; detailed and interesting post on what caused the Windows
Azure cloud outage on February 29th, 2012. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IMHO&lt;/span&gt; many of these
failures were predictable, and the bulk of the outage was caused by
a combination of inputs not being checked for validity in code, or
the invalid case not being handled&amp;nbsp;properly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

just 9 days after they released their Android app. Well, not only are
they based mostly on open source software (well, yeah, pretty much a
given for web startups these days), but they&amp;#8217;ve dealt with scaling
issues like a million new users in 12 hours, and they&amp;#8217;re &lt;a href="http://instagram-engineering.tumblr.com/post/20541814340/keeping-instagram-up-with-over-a-million-new-users-in"&gt;talking about

read, thought was wonderful, and wanted to comment on. At risk of
letting it pile up forever, here&amp;#8217;s a collection of links that I thought
were really interesting or&amp;nbsp;insightful&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://blog.mongodb.org/post/172254834/mongodb-is-fantastic-for-logging"&gt;MongoDB is Fantastic for
    Logging&lt;/a&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I was looking into some log storage ideas, and came by this post
(on the MongoDB blog) about why Mongo is well-suited to storing&amp;nbsp;logs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.sonian.com/cloud-monitoring-sensu/"&gt;Sensu&lt;/a&gt; - a
    Ruby-based cloud-oriented monitoring system. It uses &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AMQP&lt;/span&gt;/RabbitMQ
    to communicate between the clients and server, which is a really big
    part of what I think monitoring should&amp;nbsp;be.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://highscalability.com/"&gt;High Scalability&lt;/a&gt; - this is one of the
    few blogs I follow on a regular basis. Some really wonderful stuff,
    and great food for&amp;nbsp;thought.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://everythingsysadmin.com/2012/03/fear-of-rebooting.html"&gt;Everything Sysadmin: Fear of
    Rebooting&lt;/a&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A great article on Tom Limoncelli&amp;#8217;s blog about why we fear
rebooting machines and why this is bad - moreover, why we should
reboot&amp;nbsp;often.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://techblog.netflix.com/2012/02/fault-tolerance-in-high-volume.html"&gt;The Netflix Tech Blog: Fault Tolerance in a High Volume,
    Distributed
    System&lt;/a&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is a &lt;em&gt;really, really&lt;/em&gt; cool post NetFlix about how latency
increases in a single subsystem can bring down their whole &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; in
seconds, and how they combat this. Really cool&amp;nbsp;stuff.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://arstechnica.com/business/news/2012/04/exclusive-a-behind-the-scenes-look-at-facebook-release-engineering.ars/1"&gt;Ars Technica - Exclusive: a behind-the-scenes look at Facebook
    release
    engineering&lt;/a&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ars Technical is more or less &amp;#8220;mainstream media&amp;#8221; to me, but this
is a really interesting writeup on Facebook&amp;#8217;s release engineering
process, albeit at a higher level. Specifically, it talks about
their automation, phased rollouts, rollbacks, and how they release
the Facebook codebase as a single giant binary, sent out via&amp;nbsp;BitTorrent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/monitoringsucks/blog-posts"&gt;Monitoring Sucks blog posts
    (github)&lt;/a&gt; - The
    &amp;#8220;monitoing sucks&amp;#8221; movement really speaks to me, having worked
    extensively with Nagios, Cacti, and similar technologies.
    Specifically, having rolled out monitoring in a variety of &amp;#8220;weird&amp;#8221;
    scenarios (a lot of monitoring devices or whole networks behind &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NAT&lt;/span&gt;,
    on dynamic &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IP&lt;/span&gt; connections, or otherwise unreachable from a central
    server), I&amp;#8217;ve felt a lot of pain in the current want of doing
    things. There are a lot of &lt;strong&gt;really&lt;/strong&gt; good thoughts linked here,
    especially the &lt;a href="http://jedi.be/blog/2012/01/03/monitoring-wonderland-survey-introduction"&gt;&amp;#8220;wonderland&amp;#8221; series by Patrick
    Debois&lt;/a&gt;
    and the &lt;a href="http://holmwood.id.au/~lindsay/2012/01/09/monitoring-sucks-latency-sucks-more"&gt;&amp;#8220;Latency sucks&amp;#8221; series by Lindsay
    Holmwood&lt;/a&gt;.
    This really got me thinking about my ideal monitoring system, which
    among other things, would integrate the &amp;#8220;alerting&amp;#8221; functions of
    Nagios with graphing/trending and correlation, would be based on
    some sort of message queue architecture (that supports multiple
    levels of proxies that could gracefully support &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NAT&lt;/span&gt; and multiple
    hops), and would be configured almost totally on the originating
    &amp;#8220;client&amp;#8221; (unlike the pain of distributed&amp;nbsp;Nagios/Icinga).&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PDF&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;presentation slides. I&amp;#8217;d &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; to see the video. Some really good
ideas about putting the science back into being a SysAdmin. Also
mentions a few tools I really want to play around with (including
ganglia, graphite, logster and StatsD). Also mentions adding &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt;
memory usage and time to Apache logs, which I don&amp;#8217;t believe I never
thought&amp;nbsp;of.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some really thoughtful posts from &lt;span class="caps"&gt;R. I.&lt;/span&gt; Pienaar on &lt;a href="http://www.devco.net/archives/2011/03/19/thinking_about_monitoring_frameworks.php"&gt;Thinking about

    frameworks&lt;/a&gt;
    and &lt;a href="http://www.devco.net/archives/2011/04/04/monitoring_framework_composable_architectures.php"&gt;Composable
    Architectures&lt;/a&gt;.
    Some really good stuff, but what else would you expect from someone
    &lt;a href="https://github.com/ripienaar/"&gt;like this&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">admin</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 21 Apr 2012 10:24:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:blog.jasonantman.com,2012-04-21:2012/04/a-collection-of-great-links-on-monitoring-sysadmin-scaling-etc/</guid><category>amqp</category><category>etsy</category><category>facebook</category><category>limoncelli</category><category>links</category><category>mongodb</category><category>monitoring</category><category>monitoringsucks</category><category>netflix</category><category>sensu</category></item><item><title>Rsync on an Android phone</title><link>http://blog.jasonantman.com/2012/04/rsync-on-an-android-phone/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Every once in a while, there are some files that I want kept in sync
between my Android-based phone and one of my Linux (or Mac, or any Unix,
or maybe Windows too, but I use Linux&amp;#8230;) boxes. Yeah, I can copy them
over manually via &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USB&lt;/span&gt; or even something a bit simpler like
&lt;a href="https://market.android.com/details?id=lysesoft.andftp"&gt;AndFTP&lt;/a&gt;
(assuming you can &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SCP&lt;/span&gt; to the target machine). But that&amp;#8217;s a real pain for
anything like my &lt;a href="http://keepass.info/"&gt;KeePass&lt;/a&gt; (well, actually
&lt;a href="http://www.keepassx.org/"&gt;KeePassX&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href="https://market.android.com/details?id=com.android.keepass"&gt;KeePassDroid&lt;/a&gt;)
password database, that I might add something to at any time and forget
to sync. I also try to occasionally (waiting in line?) backup &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SMS&lt;/span&gt;, call
logs, etc. on my phone, and like to have those synced back to the
desktop&amp;nbsp;automatically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enter the solution: &lt;a href="https://market.android.com/details?id=eu.kowalczuk.rsync4android"&gt;rsync backup for
Android&lt;/a&gt;,
a &lt;a href="http://rsync.samba.org/"&gt;rsync&lt;/a&gt; client for Android that includes
Tasker plugins (there are a few things about the app that I don&amp;#8217;t like,
but it seems to be the only option at the moment), and
&lt;a href="https://market.android.com/details?id=net.dinglisch.android.taskerm"&gt;Tasker&lt;/a&gt;,
an automation framework for Android.Tasker is one of the few Android
apps that I&amp;#8217;ve actually bought (i.e. not free/no-cost), and is currently
selling for $6.49. It&amp;#8217;s an incredibly capable task automator, very much
akin to &lt;a href="http://www.twofortyfouram.com/"&gt;Locale&lt;/a&gt; on steroids. On the
down side, Tasker can eat up battery life if you don&amp;#8217;t configure it
intelligently, and it&amp;#8217;s not &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; 100% reliable when interacting with
the system. On the positive side, Tasker can identify practically any
combination of states in the android system (from hardware and software
events to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPS&lt;/span&gt; location, time, signal status, etc.) and perform almost
any task on the system based on this information. Sure, this specific
problem could be solved with a cron replacement (which Android lacks, of
course), but Tasker can do things like play specific audio files when
you get an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SMS&lt;/span&gt; from a specific number, mute audio at certain &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPS&lt;/span&gt;
locations, or turn WiFi on when I get home and off when I leave the
house. It also has a plugin architecture, and rsync backup for Android
happens to have a plugin that works with&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, our goal is to have a daily, bi-directional, newest-file-wins sync
between a directory on our Android phone and a directory on a computer.
I&amp;#8217;m not going to go into a lot of the computer-side stuff, mainly
because that varies quite a bit between operating systems, and also
because my personal setup is a bit paranoid in terms of security. For
the computer side, we&amp;#8217;ll need a machine that can be SSHed to from the
Internet (either a static &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IP&lt;/span&gt; or a known hostname/dynamic &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DNS&lt;/span&gt;), a user
that can run rsync over &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SSH&lt;/span&gt;, and a directory that&amp;#8217;s writable&amp;nbsp;(obviously).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Setup:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buy and install the
    &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.dinglisch.android.taskerm"&gt;Tasker&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install the &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=eu.kowalczuk.rsync4android"&gt;rsync backup for
    Android&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Configure the rsync stuff on the computer. In the simplest form,
    we&amp;#8217;ll just need a user that can login and run rsync, and a directory
    to sync from/to &lt;em&gt;(note: this should be a directory used only for
    syncing the&amp;nbsp;phone&amp;#8230;).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open the rsync backup for Android app. Use Menu -&gt; Generate Keys to
    generate a new pair of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SSH&lt;/span&gt; keys, and then get the public key setup
    on the target computer. See &lt;a href="http://android.kowalczuk.eu/rsync4android/"&gt;the developer&amp;#8217;s web
    site&lt;/a&gt; for&amp;nbsp;instructions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once keys are setup, create a new profile called &amp;#8220;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PC&lt;/span&gt;-droid&amp;#8221;. Set the
    local directory to a new empty directory (I used &lt;code&gt;/sdcard/sync&lt;/code&gt;),
    enter the remote host address, port, username, and remote directory,
    and select the private &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SSH&lt;/span&gt; key that you created. Check off &amp;#8220;rsync on
    reverse direction&amp;#8221;. As this program is just a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GUI&lt;/span&gt; wrapper around
    normal rsync binaries, you can specify additional options to the
    rsync command; my string ended up being
    &lt;code&gt;-vHrltDuO --chmod=Du+rwx,go-rwx,Fu+rw,go-rw --no-perms&lt;/code&gt;. If it
    helps, at the bottom of the screen you can see the actual rsync
    command line that will be run. Save when&amp;nbsp;done.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Save the profile, then long-press it and select &amp;#8220;Duplicate&amp;#8221;. Change
    the name to &amp;#8220;droid-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PC&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8221;, uncheck &amp;#8220;rsync in reverse direction&amp;#8221;, and
    change your additional options as needed (mine became
    &lt;code&gt;-vHrltDu --chmod=Dug+rwx,o-rwx,Fug+rw,o-rw --no-perms&lt;/code&gt;). Save when&amp;nbsp;done.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a test file in the sync directory on the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PC&lt;/span&gt;, and a different
    one in the sync directory on the&amp;nbsp;droid.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One at a time, in the rsync backup app, tap on the profile names. If
    all goes well, the syncs should run, and both files will now be in
    both places. If there are any problems, the output should help; the
    most likely issues are probably permissions, rsync command options,
    or &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SSH&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;keys.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Long-press each profile, select &amp;#8220;Edit&amp;#8221;, and check off &amp;#8220;Close log
    window after job is done&amp;#8221;. Save&amp;nbsp;profile.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now fire up Tasker. Click the &amp;#8220;+&amp;#8221; at the bottom of the screen to
    create a new profile, call it &amp;#8220;sync&amp;#8221;, and click the check&amp;nbsp;mark.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On the First Context panel, tap Time, and select when you want the
    jobs to run; I chose 03:01. Tap the check&amp;nbsp;mark.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On the Task Selection panel, tap New Task. Give it a name, like&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8220;sync2&amp;#8221;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On the Task Edit panel, tap the &amp;#8220;+&amp;#8221; button at the bottom left, tap
    Plugin, tap &amp;#8220;rsync backup for Android&amp;#8221;, click the &amp;#8220;Edit&amp;#8221; button on
    the Configuration line, and select the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PC&lt;/span&gt;-droid rsync profile. Tap
    the check mark in the lower left to&amp;nbsp;save.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Repeat the last step for the droid-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PC&lt;/span&gt; rsync&amp;nbsp;profile.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tap the check box in the lower left. This saves the&amp;nbsp;profile.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the main Tasker screen, make sure there&amp;#8217;s a green check to the
    right of the profile you just added, and that the button at the
    bottom right of the screen is set to&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8220;On&amp;#8221;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assuming this all went well, the next time the time you specified rolls
around, your sync should run. If you gave the task a name in step 12,
you can setup additional profiles to run it at other times (or use the
repeat logic&amp;nbsp;builtin).&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">admin</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 04 Apr 2012 20:40:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:blog.jasonantman.com,2012-04-04:2012/04/rsync-on-an-android-phone/</guid><category>android</category><category>rsync</category><category>tasker</category></item><item><title>Github as a repository in Redmine</title><link>http://blog.jasonantman.com/2012/03/github-as-a-repository-in-redmine/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;As a follow-up to my &lt;a href="/2012/03/cvs-to-svn-to-git/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CVS&lt;/span&gt; to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SVN&lt;/span&gt; to Git&lt;/a&gt;

setting up the repository

Theme&lt;/a&gt; post
from a few days ago, I decided on the
&lt;a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/admired"&gt;Admired&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="http://wp-ultra.com/themes/admired/"&gt;theme&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="https://plus.google.com/103391260195864203534/posts"&gt;Brad
Thomas&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;#8217;s
amazingly full-featured and has a good set of options. I had to manually
change a few things in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CSS&lt;/span&gt; (I wanted to tweak the top bar colors a
bit in a way that&amp;#8217;s not supported in the options), but overall it was a
very simple transition. While it&amp;#8217;s unfortunately very far from valid
&lt;a href="http://validator.w3.org/check?verbose=1&amp;amp;uri=http://blog.jasonantman.com/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
or
&lt;a href="http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?profile=css3&amp;amp;warning=0&amp;amp;uri=http://blog.jasonantman.com/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CSS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,
it seems quite&amp;nbsp;nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you happen to read this post and see anything wrong with the theme,
or it doesn&amp;#8217;t display properly for you, please leave a comment below

&lt;p&gt;My next project, continuing on from my &lt;a href="/2012/03/inaccuracies-in-google-analytics-for-website-stats/"&gt;Inaccuracies in Google Analytics

post, is to compare the two self-hosted JavaScript-based open source
Google Analytics alternatives I&amp;#8217;ve identified
(&lt;a href="http://piwik.org/"&gt;Piwik&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.openwebanalytics.com/"&gt;Open Web
Analytics&lt;/a&gt;) and try one out on my site
(keeping in mind that my server is pretty heavily loaded, and I don&amp;#8217;t
want to push it over the edge). Once I come to some sort of conclusion
on that, I&amp;#8217;ll get back to some useful&amp;nbsp;posts.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">admin</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 20 Mar 2012 19:25:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:blog.jasonantman.com,2012-03-20:2012/03/new-blog-theme/</guid><category>blog</category><category>theme</category><category>wordpress</category></item><item><title>Some Thoughts on Choosing a New Wordpress Theme</title><link>http://blog.jasonantman.com/2012/03/some-thoughts-on-choosing-a-new-wordpress-theme/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I think I&amp;#8217;m going to choose a new theme for my blog. The current theme
is &lt;a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/inove"&gt;iNove&lt;/a&gt; (albeit an older
version with some custom modifications), and I feel like it looks a bit
messy and has gotten a bit cluttered, so it&amp;#8217;s time to find something
new. I like the 2-column layout, and have a few other things I&amp;#8217;m looking
for - specifically, aside from something with advanced features like
lots of widget support and hooks, something that has good visual
separation between different posts and widgets. I also really want
something, if possible, with relative column widths. My current home and
work desktops both have dual monitors, and the minimum resolution I have
on one screen is 1920x1080. When I look at my blog in a maximized
window, about half the screen width is wasted with empty space. So,
ideally, I&amp;#8217;d like a theme that&amp;#8217;s based on relative widths, probably with
a &amp;#8220;min-width&amp;#8221; property so it wouldn&amp;#8217;t get compressed to an absurdly
narrow width on small&amp;nbsp;screens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/"&gt;Google Analytics&lt;/a&gt; (as noted in
the &lt;a href="/privacy-policy/"&gt;privacy policy&lt;/a&gt;) for visitor statistics on this
blog (more about that in a moment). So, I took a peek at the breakdown
of visitors by screen resolution, and saw that for the past year, 94% of
the 27,500 visits had a screen width of 1024px or more (and the majority
of the others looked like mobile device resolutions, so they&amp;#8217;d probably
zoom the page correctly). So, my first gut reaction was to assume that I
could use a theme approximately 1000px wide. Unfortunately, there&amp;#8217;s two
main problems with that: first, as mentioned by &lt;a href="http://css-tricks.com/screen-resolution-notequalto-browser-window/"&gt;Chris Coyier on
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CSS&lt;/span&gt;-Tricks.com&lt;/a&gt;,
just because someone has a given screen resolution doesn&amp;#8217;t mean their
browser window (let alone the viewport) is that size. As a matter of
fact, I usually have my main browser window set at about 80% of the
width of one of my monitors, with my instant messaging client
&lt;a href="http://pidgin.im/"&gt;Pidgin&lt;/a&gt; taking up the rest of the space. So there&amp;#8217;s
one inaccuracy. There&amp;#8217;s a potentially much greater inaccuracy in my
stats as well, which I&amp;#8217;m going to discuss in a &lt;a href="/2012/03/inaccuracies-in-google-analytics-for-website-stats/"&gt;separate
post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">admin</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 17 Mar 2012 11:48:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:blog.jasonantman.com,2012-03-17:2012/03/some-thoughts-on-choosing-a-new-wordpress-theme/</guid><category>analysis</category><category>analytics</category><category>blog</category><category>google</category><category>logging</category><category>stats</category><category>theme</category><category>wordpress</category></item><item><title>Inaccuracies in Google Analytics for Website Stats</title><link>http://blog.jasonantman.com/2012/03/inaccuracies-in-google-analytics-for-website-stats/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I use Google Analytics for visitor stats on this blog. Not because I&amp;#8217;m
trying to direct-market to my readers or become Big Brother, but for a
number of simple&amp;nbsp;reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;#8217;s simple - no software for me to update, and nothing that needs
    to run on my server and read through giant log files every night.
    Google does it all for&amp;nbsp;me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It gives a lot more information than I can get from just web server&amp;nbsp;logs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Because of Google&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;big brother&amp;#8221; tracking, and the vast number of
    sites that they track people on, I can tell things I&amp;#8217;d have no other
    way of knowing, like how long someone stayed on my&amp;nbsp;page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They tell me &lt;em&gt;useful&lt;/em&gt; stats like which search keywords brought the
    most people to my site and which posts are the most popular, which I
    keep in mind when writing new stuff and updating older&amp;nbsp;posts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They tell me information about client operating system and browser
    version, which I think tells quite a bit about my&amp;nbsp;audience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As far as I know, they&amp;#8217;re pretty good at filtering out anything
    other than an actual human&amp;nbsp;visitor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They tell me stats that have no real use to me, but are just cook -
    like what countries my visitors are from, what type of Internet
    connection they&amp;#8217;re on, their screen resolution,&amp;nbsp;etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously not for google, but for me, all of these stats are totally
anonymous - I just get percentages or numbers of visits, it&amp;#8217;s not like I
can see all of the details per-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;IP&lt;/span&gt; address. The most important aspect to
me is just the ease of use - I sign up and put a little snippet of code
on my pages, and I get an amazing dashboard interface with all of this
information. Nothing to install and update on my server, and (most
importantly, since I&amp;#8217;m now running everything of mine on one virtualized
server) no massive program to run as a cron job that has to read all my
server log&amp;nbsp;files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week I was talking with a couple of my co-workers, specifically
about the stats that I get from Google Analytics. While I know it&amp;#8217;s not
uncommon to run &lt;a href="http://noscript.net/"&gt;NoScript&lt;/a&gt; especially among the
more security- and privacy-conscious groups of people, I was a bit
disturbed to hear that they all block Google&amp;#8217;s tracking code in their
browsers via NoScript. I assume there&amp;#8217;s also a percentage of people who
still just turn off JavaScript alltogether (although I can&amp;#8217;t imagine how
they use the modern Web), and many who use the &lt;a href="http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en"&gt;Google Analytics
Opt-Out&lt;/a&gt; feature. So,
especially with as technical an audience as I have, I guess that means
I&amp;#8217;m likely missing a large number of visitors in my stats. On one hand,
I want to respect the privacy of my visitors, and respect their desire
to opt-out of advanced tracking. On the other hand, since I no longer
parse web server logs for statistics, these privacy-conscious visitors
aren&amp;#8217;t even showing up in what I think of as my monthly visit count, or
in my information on what posts and search keywords are most popular,
which I only use for &amp;#8220;good&amp;#8221; purposes - to make my blog more useful. So
that&amp;#8217;s a bit of a&amp;nbsp;conundrum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ll admit that I do run &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/adsense/"&gt;Google AdSense
Ads&lt;/a&gt; on my blog, and I&amp;#8217;m sure there are
some people who block the ads. On one hand, that upsets me a bit; I run
this blog to try and share information that I find or learn with others,
and the hosting costs aren&amp;#8217;t insignificant. If I can get paid to just
show some ads, to try and help offset the cost of running the site, I
think that&amp;#8217;s good. And if other people can help support the site by just
letting the ads stay on the page, why not? On the other hand, my hosting
costs $50/month (granted the server also handles all of my email, and a
&lt;em&gt;whole bunch&lt;/em&gt; of other sites). I&amp;#8217;ve been participating in Google AdSense
since March 5, 2010 (two years and two weeks), and my &amp;#8220;estimated
earnings&amp;#8221; are currently $80. The payout is in $100 increments. So, I
haven&amp;#8217;t seen a cent from it in two years, so I&amp;#8217;ve given up being
concerned with it. If you want to be nice, and find my posts
interesting, click on one of the ads. Unfortunately, unless I get
famous, the ads aren&amp;#8217;t going to come close to offsetting even part of
the cost of running the&amp;nbsp;site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google itself
&lt;a href="http://support.google.com/googleanalytics/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;amp;answer=55610"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;,
&amp;#8220;In order for Google Analytics to record a visit, the visitor must have
JavaScript, images, and cookies enabled for your website.&amp;#8221; There seems
to be some buzz about this on the &amp;#8216;net, and I&amp;#8217;ve seen
&lt;a href="http://garmahis.com/tips/google-analytics/#use-Google-Analytics-without-JavaScript"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="http://djangosnippets.org/snippets/2338/"&gt;number&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;amp;sl=nl&amp;amp;u=http://andrescholten.nl/google-analytics-zonder-javascript/"&gt;of&lt;/a&gt;
(translated; &lt;a href="http://andrescholten.nl/google-analytics-zonder-javascript/"&gt;original post in
Dutch&lt;/a&gt;)
posts advocating building a request to a Google Analytics &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GIF&lt;/span&gt; manually
on the server side, and then including it as an image element inside a
&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;noscript&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag in the page. While this is probably one of the nicer
solutions (and much more likely to reduce double-counting), it doesn&amp;#8217;t
capture any of the advanced data (screen resolution, etc.) that
JavaScript-based Analytics does, and more importantly, I imagine that
many of the Ad blocking extensions also block traffic to
google-analytics.com, so this is an incremental improvement at best.
There are also
&lt;a href="http://www.vdgraaf.info/google-analytics-without-javascript.html"&gt;quite&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="http://blog.datalicious.com/google-analytics-without-javascript-rss-xml-e"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="http://blogs.walkerart.org/newmedia/2009/11/12/building-walkers-mobile-site-google-analytics-without-javascript-pt2/"&gt;few&lt;/a&gt;
posts about how to make a request to Analytics purely server-side. This
has a few disadvantages as well; it bypasses the google domain
blacklisting problem that the client-side image has, but it also means
you lose the client &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IP&lt;/span&gt; address (and therefore geolocation), and that you
double-track any user who allows javascript (so you need a separate
profile, and then need to average out the results). It also means that
you track every search engine and bot that crawls your site, and
possibly every person who clicks a link and then hits &amp;#8220;back&amp;#8221; before the
page finishes loading. I found another blogger who &lt;a href="http://www.realityburst.com/battle-of-the-inaccuracies-how-accurate-is-google-analyticsawstatsstatpress"&gt;commented
about&lt;/a&gt;
the wide disparity he saw between Google Analytics, the
&lt;a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/statpress/"&gt;StatsPress&lt;/a&gt; WordPress
plugin, and &lt;a href="http://awstats.sourceforge.net/"&gt;AWstats&lt;/a&gt; (a server-side
log file&amp;nbsp;analyzer).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So what&amp;#8217;s the&amp;nbsp;solution?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the options have a down side, but I&amp;#8217;m looking for something
that&amp;#8217;s the best I can reasonably do. As much as I&amp;#8217;d rather not, I&amp;#8217;m
going to look into self-hosted alternatives to Google Analytics (a
self-hosted JavaScript-based stats provider), in the hopes that NoScript
users will be more friendly to scripts coming from my own domain, and
sending requests to my own domain, than ones from Google or other major
trackers. I don&amp;#8217;t think I want to try anything that parses web server
logs as a primary approach, as I don&amp;#8217;t think I could ever get a
meaningful comparison to Google Analytics or something else&amp;nbsp;JavaScript-based.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did have one other idea which I think is interesting, though a bit of
an overhead. I could have Apache (or, more likely, a Perl script called
in the Apache configuration) generate a random string for each request,
and save it in an Apache environment variable. The environment variable
would then be added to a field in the server logs, and also added (via
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt; or whatever else generates the pages server-side) as a custom
parameter for the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JS&lt;/span&gt; tracking code, enabling page hits to be correlated
between the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JS&lt;/span&gt; tracking and the server logs. Assuming the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JS&lt;/span&gt; tacking
backend stores its data in a sane format (and as raw data, not just
aggregated), and at the cost of a serious performance penalty, a
server-side statistics program like
&lt;a href="http://awstats.sourceforge.net/"&gt;AWstats&lt;/a&gt; or
&lt;a href="http://www.webalizer.org/"&gt;Webalizer&lt;/a&gt; could be patched to lookup the
unique identifier in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JS&lt;/span&gt; stats data store, and ignore all hits which
were tracked that&amp;nbsp;way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m going to start by looking into self-hosted open source alternatives
to Google Analytics, which I&amp;#8217;ll post about sometime hopefully&amp;nbsp;soon.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">admin</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 17 Mar 2012 11:46:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:blog.jasonantman.com,2012-03-17:2012/03/inaccuracies-in-google-analytics-for-website-stats/</guid><category>analytics</category><category>google</category><category>logging</category><category>statistics</category><category>stats</category></item><item><title>Petit for Log Analysis</title><link>http://blog.jasonantman.com/2012/02/petit-for-log-analysis/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I recently discovered the
&lt;a href="http://crunchtools.com/software/petit/"&gt;petit&lt;/a&gt; program for log
analysis. It&amp;#8217;s a simple tool to pull out useful information from syslog
logs in a variety of ways. I&amp;#8217;ve only used it a few times so far, mainly
on logs from problems I&amp;#8217;ve already solved but didn&amp;#8217;t know the cause of
at first. So far, it&amp;#8217;s proven quite useful. Here are a few&amp;nbsp;examples:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;petit --wordcount /var/log/messages&lt;/code&gt; - displays ordered count of
    words appearing in the log. My first step, especially if &amp;#8220;warning&amp;#8221;,
    &amp;#8220;error&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;fatal&amp;#8221; shows up near the&amp;nbsp;top&amp;#8230;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;petit --hash --fingerprint /var/log/messages&lt;/code&gt; - hashes the log,
    removes filters (such as numerics, datestamp), and displays count of
    matching lines. Absolutely wonderful for web error logs, as it
    removes client &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IP&lt;/span&gt; addresses, line numbers,&amp;nbsp;etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;petit --mgraph /var/log/messages&lt;/code&gt; - graph messages per minute for
    the first hour of the log (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ASCII&lt;/span&gt; of&amp;nbsp;course)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;petit --hgraph /var/log/messages&lt;/code&gt; - same as above, but messages per
    hour for the first&amp;nbsp;day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Petit will also read from stdin with the &amp;#8212;Xgraph options, so you
    can &lt;code&gt;cat logfile | grep word | petit --mgraph&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just one note - this tool appears to work only on standard syslog
formatted logs. If some non-datestamped lines managed to work their way
into the log (i.e. someone used echo &gt;&gt; logfile instead of &lt;code&gt;logger&lt;/code&gt;),
it will&amp;nbsp;choke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many thanks to Scott McCarty for this wonderful&amp;nbsp;tool!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">admin</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 21 Feb 2012 11:57:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>tag:blog.jasonantman.com,2012-02-21:2012/02/petit-for-log-analysis/</guid><category>analysis</category><category>log</category><category>logging</category><category>petit</category><category>syslog</category></item><item><title>Two Interesting Conference Presentations</title><link>http://blog.jasonantman.com/2012/01/two-interesting-conference-presentations/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Two interesting presentations - which, unfortunately, I only heard the

how the brain is manipulated in advertising and&amp;nbsp;otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the techie-geeks among us (well, given the other link, &amp;#8220;geeks&amp;#8221; would
be too vague), &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0mHo7SMCQk&amp;amp;list=PLC394849408B5F203&amp;amp;index=5&amp;amp;feature=plpp_video"&gt;Velocity 2011: Theo Schlossnagle, &amp;#8220;Career
Development&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt;.
It&amp;#8217;s a bit of a rant, but a good talk for us infrastructure/ops people,
and developers as well, and covers some thoughts on both careers and how
we should do out&amp;nbsp;jobs.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">admin</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 25 Jan 2012 21:07:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>tag:blog.jasonantman.com,2012-01-25:2012/01/two-interesting-conference-presentations/</guid></item><item><title>Firefox QR Code Generator</title><link>http://blog.jasonantman.com/2012/01/firefox-qr-code-generator/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Just a quick little tip, I happened by the &lt;a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/mobile-barcoder/"&gt;Mobile
Barcoder&lt;/a&gt;
Firefox add-on the other day. It&amp;#8217;s a Firefox add-on that generates &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qr_code"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;QR&lt;/span&gt;
Code&lt;/a&gt; barcodes for text or links,
right in your browser. While my Droid3 has a full keyboard, sometimes I
still want to quickly send links from my desktop browser session to my
phone. Firefox Sync helps a lot but is a bit slow on the phone (since I
usually have 100+ tabs open between all of my desktop Firefox sessions),
and email is an option but a bit&amp;nbsp;slower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two caveats about this add-on&amp;nbsp;though:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The feature to generate a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;QR&lt;/span&gt; code for the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt; of the current page
    shows up in the status bar, which isn&amp;#8217;t shown in modern versions of
    Firefox. You&amp;#8217;ll need to enable the &lt;a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/what-add-bar"&gt;Add-on
    bar&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It uses the
    &lt;a href="http://mobilecodes.nokia.com/"&gt;http://mobilecodes.nokia.com/&lt;/a&gt;
    server to generate barcodes, so it&amp;#8217;s dependent on connectivity and
    that&amp;nbsp;service.&lt;/li&gt;

least a bit about the
&lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/2011/10/12/tech/mobile/blackberry-outage/"&gt;massive&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/technology/2011/10/blackberry-outage-spreads-to-u-s/"&gt;blackberry&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/14/technology/rim-struggles-to-overcome-blackberry-outages.html?_r=1"&gt;outage&lt;/a&gt;
over the past three days. While yes, it&amp;#8217;s the first truly grand failure
of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RIM&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s infrastructure in their 12-year history, it&amp;#8217;s also a wonderful
case&amp;nbsp;study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently the outage started Monday morning with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RIM&lt;/span&gt; infrastructure in
Europe, the Middle East and Asia. However, by Wednesday, it had become a
global outage/slowdown of BlackBerry infrastructure (specifically the
parts that go through &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RIM&lt;/span&gt; - email, web browsing, and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BBM&lt;/span&gt;; voice calls
and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SMS&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;MMS&lt;/span&gt; were unaffected). With BlackBerry&amp;#8217;s market share falling,
Android&amp;#8217;s rapidly growing (and Android slowly becoming a viable
enterprise option), and the launch of the iPhone 4S just around the
corner, the timing of this couldn&amp;#8217;t be worse for&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;RIM&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;RIM&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s original
&lt;a href="http://www.rim.com/newsroom/service-update.shtml"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; about the
problem, at 21:30 on Tuesday October 11th,&amp;nbsp;was,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The messaging and browsing delays that some of you are still
experiencing were caused by a core switch failure within &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RIM&lt;/span&gt;’s
infrastructure. Although the system is designed to failover to a
back-up switch, the failover did not function as previously tested. As
a result, a large backlog of data was generated and we are now working
to clear that backlog and restore normal service as quickly as
possible. We sincerely apologise for the inconvenience caused to many
of you and we will continue to keep you&amp;nbsp;informed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;#8217;t been able to find much more technical information than that -
a &lt;a href="http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9220736/RIM_global_outage_caused_by_core_switch_failure_fix_under_way"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CNET&lt;/span&gt; article from
Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;
goes into as much depth as anything I could find. I did find one mention
(misplaced the link) that the core switch in question uses technology
from &amp;#8220;multiple vendors&amp;#8221;. So what follows is part common sense (for me&amp;#8230;
why not for a multi-national corporation?) and part speculation. If
you&amp;#8217;re unfamiliar with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RIM&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s architecture, the pertinent points are that
all Internet-bound traffic (browsing, email, and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BBM&lt;/span&gt;) is piped through
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;RIM&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s data centers, where it&amp;#8217;s encypted and who-knows-what-else&amp;#8217;ed
(perhaps
&lt;a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970204612504576608561811929654.html"&gt;monitored&lt;/a&gt;)
before going back out onto the &amp;#8216;net. In the Enterprise market, their big
claim is encryption/security, and monitoring/management/policy
enforcement on&amp;nbsp;handsets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First main point: &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RIM&lt;/span&gt; is a &lt;em&gt;big&lt;/em&gt; company. The thought that they rely on
an (apparently custom) core switch - a &lt;em&gt;single&lt;/em&gt; core switch for multiple
&lt;em&gt;continents&lt;/em&gt; - is amazing. It&amp;#8217;s even more amazing that they&amp;#8217;d let such a
large part of their infrastructure ride on an architecture with,
apparently, an untested failover mechanism. Of course I don&amp;#8217;t know all
the details, but I&amp;#8217;d hope that for a single piece of hardware which is
so critical, they&amp;#8217;d a) have a cold spare physically nearby so a
replacement wouldn&amp;#8217;t take a day or two, and b) if they can&amp;#8217;t do an
online failover test, at least have a full lab environment to test the
failover&amp;nbsp;in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second main point: Their big claim through all of this is that they
didn&amp;#8217;t lose any data - email, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BBM&lt;/span&gt;, etc. - it just got delayed. So if
there was a core switch failure in their data center serving &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EMEA&lt;/span&gt;, and
the next day global services slowed to a crawl, the only thing that
comes to mind to me is a waterfall; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EMEA&lt;/span&gt; went down, and they started
rerouting traffic to their North America data center. The increased load
- probably a disaster recovery plan they never truly tested or even
planned - brought everything to a screeching halt, and caused them to
resort to simply caching messaging and pushing it out bit by bit as the
infrastructure could handle.&amp;nbsp;Oops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what are my (admittedly poorly-informed) thoughts on&amp;nbsp;this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scaling out works. Scaling up - especially with single points of
    failure, or N+1 redundancy - is dangerous. If &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RIM&lt;/span&gt; had scaled out and
    used regional data centers, with a close-to-commodity core and as
    much redundancy as possible, this wouldn&amp;#8217;t have happened. Sure,
    infrastructure costs money. But if that one &amp;#8220;core switch&amp;#8221; had been
    1,000 devices spread across multiple racks in multiple data centers,
    this never would have happened. And the devices would be
    comparatively cheap enough to probably keep spares on hand too. And
    regularly test their failover procedures. To all of the big
    businesses (apparently like &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RIM&lt;/span&gt;) who still think that big iron is
    the only way to do things right&amp;#8230; maybe it&amp;#8217;s time to take a hard
    look at that, and compare your architecture to that of the modern,
    new, hip giants like Google and Facebook. Grids and clusters. Nodes
    that can fail without anyone blinking. Scaling out might not fix
    every problem, but having half the world on a single core switch
    with N+1 redundancy probably isn&amp;#8217;t smart&amp;nbsp;either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disasters need to be planned for. Every possible contingency needs
    to be planned for. Plans need to be tested, regularly. If your giant
    core switch goes down and the failover doesn&amp;#8217;t &amp;#8220;function as
    previously tested&amp;#8221;, there&amp;#8217;s a serious problem both in your disaster
    planning, and in your validation and test procedure. If you have
    half of your customer base riding on a failover plan that isn&amp;#8217;t
    &lt;em&gt;regularly&lt;/em&gt; tested or otherwise validated, that&amp;#8217;s bad. While I can
    argue that the whole architecture - given this massive point of
    failure - could stand to be re-thought, the real issue here is with
    test/validation methodologies and procedures. For a company with 70
    million users, having a piece of infrastructure this critical fail,
    and the failover &amp;#8216;not work as tested&amp;#8217; is a very serious&amp;nbsp;issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Damage control is important. As I said, I can only imagine that the
    severe service degradation outside of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EMEA&lt;/span&gt; was due to rerouting data
    from &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EMEA&lt;/span&gt; to the remaining functional data center(s). Such a
    solution should only be considered if it has been tested, or at
    least has engineering validation. If it was part of the disaster
    recovery plan, it obviously isn&amp;#8217;t actually a suitable solution, and
    served only to increase the scope of the outage. If it wasn&amp;#8217;t part
    of the disaster recovery plan, and was decided on-the-fly, someone
    really didn&amp;#8217;t do their research and engineering before putting the
    fix in place. A workable solution should have been planned ahead of
    time. And if one wasn&amp;#8217;t, it&amp;#8217;s very bad practice - this outage shows
    the results - to put in place a fix that hasn&amp;#8217;t been thought&amp;nbsp;out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a company whose business is so telecom-focused, this seems like a
glaringly bad design that shouldn&amp;#8217;t be acceptable in a&amp;nbsp;telecom.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">admin</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 13 Oct 2011 22:20:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:blog.jasonantman.com,2011-10-13:2011/10/blackberry-oops/</guid><category>blackberry</category><category>outage</category></item><item><title>New server, and looking for work</title><link>http://blog.jasonantman.com/2011/09/new-server-and-looking-for-work/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;First off, I&amp;#8217;ve moved this blog from a server in my basement to
&lt;a href="http://www.linode.com"&gt;Linode&lt;/a&gt; virtual hosting, in preparation for my
move from New Jersey to an apartment in Georgia. This will mark the
first time since 2001 (when I was 14) that I didn&amp;#8217;t have at least a
publicly-accessible Linux server in my home. It also means that, as sad
as it is, the rack will probably all be either going in Ebay or to scrap
(after a good &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gutmann_method"&gt;Guttmann
wipe&lt;/a&gt;, of&amp;nbsp;course).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="server rack" src="/GFX/rack_2011-09-27_small.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m a bit sad to give up hosting &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DNS&lt;/span&gt; myself and having my beautiful
per-zone, per-domain, hourly &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DNS&lt;/span&gt; statistics, but that was my first move,
and Linode&amp;#8217;s web-based &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DNS&lt;/span&gt; manager is much nicer than my collection of
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt; scripts, MySQL backend, and rndc reload wrapper (and I no longer
need &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BIND&lt;/span&gt; split-horizon since the hosting is remote). Mail was next, and
I&amp;#8217;ve got one web server moved and the other on the way. The biggest
disappointment is losing my testbed for all the fun stuff I can&amp;#8217;t do (or
doesn&amp;#8217;t make sense) with a virtualized hosting provider -
&lt;a href="http://puppetlabs.com/"&gt;Puppet&lt;/a&gt;, real &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISC&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DHCP&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BIND9&lt;/span&gt;, Cisco CatOS and
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;IOS&lt;/span&gt; devices, &lt;a href="http://www.bacula.org"&gt;Bacula&lt;/a&gt;, running my own edge
router, etc. There&amp;#8217;s at least a handful of current production Rutgers
services and tools that got their start here as projects in my spare
time. But I&amp;#8217;m sure I&amp;#8217;ll make up somehow, and I&amp;#8217;m planning on putting
aside some money for a massive new desktop to run a slew of&amp;nbsp;VMs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a second note, the one thing holding back my move to Georgia is,
well, my lack of a job there. I&amp;#8217;m really just starting to look around,
and am very much hoping to find something comparable to my current
position at Rutgers - a group supporting diverse services, doing mainly
architecture and implementation of new services, a good dose of
automation and custom tool development, and hopefully also some work
with performance and availability monitoring (think
&lt;a href="http://www.nagios.org"&gt;Nagios&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.cacti.net/"&gt;Cacti&lt;/a&gt;),
logging, etc. And, of course, something that&amp;#8217;s network-focused, whether
wireless or wired. Maintaining some data center space/physical
infrastructure and occasionally working with my hands is fun too. So, if
you know anyone who&amp;#8217;s hiring a Linux/open source dude in the general
vicinity of Athens, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GA&lt;/span&gt; (including Atlanta and the surrounding area),
please give me a heads-up, or pass them along to

&lt;a href="http://www.mint.com"&gt;Mint.com&lt;/a&gt;, it&amp;#8217;s a free online personal finance
site that allows you to track spending across all of your bank accounts
and manage budgets and financial goals. Once upon a time it was a nice
little Web 2.0 startup, now it&amp;#8217;s owned by Intuit. The service is free,
but it&amp;#8217;s ad supported, albeit in an unintrusive way - &amp;#8220;partner&amp;#8221; services
(credit cards, savings accounts, etc.) are recommended. I&amp;#8217;ve been using
it for about two weeks now, with a goal of tracking my spending,
developing a budget and getting a better handle on my present and future
finances. So here are some of my impressions, considering that the
service is still growing but has been around for a&amp;nbsp;while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The&amp;nbsp;Good:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Account Sync&lt;/strong&gt; - Some things I&amp;#8217;ve read online suggest that Mint
    now uses the &lt;a href="http://yodlee.com"&gt;Yodlee&lt;/a&gt; service to sync
    transactions from your financial institutions. Whatever they use,
    they seem to be able to sync transactions and account balances from
    all of my accounts, even ones at a few small investment companies.
    The sync is fast, and they do push notifications (low balance, large
    deposits, etc.) very well. They even seem to support many more
    institutions than Quicken last time I used it (2010 I&amp;nbsp;think).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Budgets&lt;/strong&gt; - Mint has a very nice, clean, simple monthly budget
    implementation. You tell it how much you want to spend in a given
    category in a month, and it shows a nice horizontal bar graph of how
    far through your allotment you are. It even makes some suggestions,
    and sets baseline budgets by category based on previous spending.
    About the only problem is when my bi-weely pay checks fall on odd
    weeks in the month. Most of my bills are due near the end of the
    month, and if my pay check happens to be around the same time my
    bills are due, I&amp;#8217;ll have quite a bit less cash on hand at the
    beginning of the next month than the budgets&amp;nbsp;reflect.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Categorization&lt;/strong&gt; - they do it very well. One of their big selling
    points is their categorization engine, and it seemed to get about
    80% of my purchases right, from day one. That&amp;#8217;s much better than
    anything else I&amp;#8217;ve seen. The only down side is that they only look
    at the Vendor name, not the description - so when I use my debit
    card and the vendor name is &amp;#8220;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NYCE&lt;/span&gt; Transaction&amp;#8221; but the store
    name/address is in the description, Mint is hopelessly lost. They
    offer rules to put transactions in category, but only exact matching
    on the vendor name, so there&amp;#8217;s no way to tell it to look at a
    description that includes &amp;#8220;123 Main St&amp;#8221;. From a programmer&amp;#8217;s
    perspective, they should allow rules based on either vendor name
    &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; description, and maybe they should let the user highlight or
    specify the part that matches (or a&amp;nbsp;RegEx?).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apps&lt;/strong&gt; - I haven&amp;#8217;t tried the iOS ones, but the Android app is
    pretty nice. It gives a nice quick picture of your spending and
    account balances, how you&amp;#8217;re doing with your monthly budget, and any
    alerts/messages. Transaction history isn&amp;#8217;t easily accessible and is
    per-account only, so it&amp;#8217;s hard to answer &amp;#8220;hmmm, how much did it cost
    last time I was here?&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;where did I get lunch last Tuesday?&amp;#8221;, but
    it&amp;#8217;s still handy enough to tell me how much I have left in my
    Entertainment budget, or whether I should put this big purchase on
    my credit or debit&amp;nbsp;card.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Goals&lt;/strong&gt; - Mint has a good idea with goals - it includes a number
    of pre-configured financial goals like paying off credit card debt,
    saving for retirement, or stashing away some emergency cash. But in
    order to function correctly, you must have a specific, dedicated
    account for each goal. I guess this is where Mint makes money - they
    suggest accounts with specific attributes (high interest, high
    liquidity, whatever) from their partners. But there doesn&amp;#8217;t appear
    to be a way to set up a Goal without associating it with a dedicated
    account, and (as per some forum posts I read, I haven&amp;#8217;t tried this)
    you can&amp;#8217;t associate a cash asset account with a goal, so there&amp;#8217;s no
    way to track my progress on building the Depression fund I keep
    under my&amp;nbsp;mattress.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Bad/Room for&amp;nbsp;Improvement:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Customer Service&lt;/strong&gt; - I don&amp;#8217;t know when Mint was bought up by
    Intuit, but to me, they have the feel of an agile Web 2.0 property
    that was bought up by a slow-moving bureaucratic company unable to
    keep up with customer demands or the amount of support requests.
    They use &lt;a href="http://getsatisfaction.com/"&gt;GetSatisfaction&lt;/a&gt;, a new-age
    forum-based customer &amp;#8220;community&amp;#8221; provider, for customer service. But
    their forums are filled with feature request threads that have
    &amp;#8220;we&amp;#8217;ll bring it up to Product Development and get back to you&amp;#8221;
    responses over half a year old. There appears to be very little
    follow-through or feedback on feature requests, and poor
    announcement/communication surrounding the one feature that was
    recently brought in to an invitation-only beta. Unfortunately, I get
    the general feeling (and I&amp;#8217;ve found this far too many times lately)
    that they were originally a cutting-edge, agile, fast-paced, &amp;#8220;cool&amp;#8221;
    service, developed by a team that probably stayed up all night
    coding a cool feature their users were asking for, that&amp;#8217;s now been
    swallowed up by a behemoth that wants a 6-month-long risk assessment
    before writing a line of&amp;nbsp;code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cash Tracking&lt;/strong&gt; - I understand that Mint makes money from
    recommending the services of lenders, banks, etc. But if you want to
    monetize every single feature, you&amp;#8217;re bound to fail. In this
    respect, Mint&amp;#8217;s total lack of cash accounting is a serious failure
    for many of their users (and the forums are filled with threads to
    this effect). The site allows users to manually input cash
    transactions, but that&amp;#8217;s about it. You can deduct the amount from an
    automatically-synced &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ATM&lt;/span&gt; withdrawal (just your last &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ATM&lt;/span&gt; withdrawal,
    no choice if you have multiple &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ATM&lt;/span&gt; accounts, or you and your
    partner/spouse both use the same Mint account), but that just
    complicates things further. There&amp;#8217;s also no logic of tracking cash
    on hand - you can create a &amp;#8220;Asset&amp;#8221; (cash) account, but you have to
    manually update the balance. If you&amp;#8217;re like me and use cash for
    small purchases, or often get meals at local places that only accept
    cash, this becomes quite a bit of a hassle. Even more so if, like
    me, you&amp;#8217;ve ever lost an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ATM&lt;/span&gt; card on a holiday weekend, and now keep
    some actual cash in the house. Honestly, I think this is my biggest
    complaint about Mint, and the one that&amp;#8217;s most likely to keep me
    looking for alternatives. More importantly, this has been requested
    and voted for over and over on their support forums for over a year,
    with no informational response. For a company whose developers
    aggregate and analyze data from thousands of banks, I&amp;#8217;d think that
    letting users type in a series of dollar amounts and then totaling
    it up would be pretty&amp;nbsp;easy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scheduled Transactions&lt;/strong&gt; - On the plus side, Mint parses the &amp;#8220;next
    payment due&amp;#8221; date out of credit card and loan account information,
    so it gives you nice (email, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SMS&lt;/span&gt;, and web) alerts a configurable
    number of days before. However, it doesn&amp;#8217;t even have a feature to
    set calendar reminders for when bills are due, so I&amp;#8217;m still stuck
    opening Mint and Google Calendar if I need to figure out whether I
    can make that big purchase today or if I should wait until my next
    pay check. This was also a very commonly requested feature on their
    forums, and apparently they have an invitation-only beta running.
    But I responded to the thread a few days late, so I wasn&amp;#8217;t given an
    invitation. As far as I can tell, there was never an announcement of
    the beta, and I never got a chance to check a &amp;#8220;please let me beta
    test&amp;#8221;&amp;nbsp;box.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Forecasting&lt;/strong&gt; - This is my #2 biggest issue with Mint, after the
    lack of cash tracking. And the other one most likely to drive me
    either to another service, to write my own software (again), or to
    go back to a spreadsheet. Mint is great at tracking your transaction
    history, your account balances and net worth, and your current
    monthly budget. But it has absolutely no concept of financial
    forecasting or balance predictions. If you&amp;#8217;re on a tight budget,
    this can be a problem. At the moment, I have a spreadsheet were I
    keep a list of all of my regularly recurring expenses (in date order
    over the month), my pay dates, and the combined balance of my
    checking/savings accounts. I can easily see what (within reason, not
    counting discretionary expenses) my cash on hand will be at any time
    in the month. This seems like a no-brainer necessary feature for a
    site like Mint, and combined with its great budgeting features,
    could provide a wonderful picture of what to expect in the next
    month or two, and when I should plan on making that unusually large&amp;nbsp;purchase.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Couples/Families&lt;/strong&gt; - My girlfriend and I both use Mint, and have
    somewhat combined finances (but not accounts). It doesn&amp;#8217;t make sense
    for us to have two Mint accounts, since it would be a real pain to
    keep track of. But, on the other hand, having all of our accounts in
    one Mint isn&amp;#8217;t an ideal solution either. I can categorize
    transactions, but there&amp;#8217;s no easy way to track &lt;em&gt;who&lt;/em&gt; the purchase
    was for, short of duplicating (or triplicating - Me, Her, Both) all
    of the categories. I&amp;#8217;m trying something with tags, but it&amp;#8217;s a real
    kludge in Mint&amp;#8217;s search interface to get a list of transactions
    filtered by category &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; tag. Also, the account name doesn&amp;#8217;t show
    up in the transactions list unless you pull down the Detail box for
    a transaction, so it&amp;#8217;s troublesome to look through a list and sort
    out whose cards everything was&amp;nbsp;on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Miscellaneous:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Passwords.&lt;/strong&gt; In order to sync data from my banks, I have to supply
    mint.com with all of my login credentials. I understand that, until
    banks enter the 21st century (and be smart about it - even a less
    likely possibility) this is just the way it is, and I can&amp;#8217;t blame
    Mint for a system imposed by the banks. But still, I&amp;#8217;m not too happy
    about the idea of Mint storing in plain text (I assume, since they
    need to pass them on to the bank) my username and password for all
    of my banking sites. I got some comfort knowing that the site is
    owned by Intuit - a company that, if not totally security-minded, is
    at least big enough not to fold overnight after a breach. Maybe one
    day, banks and credit card companies will let me specify separate
    credentials specific to third-party software and websites, which I
    could then revoke with my &amp;#8220;master&amp;#8221; password. Until then, I guess
    this is just a risk I have to live&amp;nbsp;with.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Importing Transactions&lt;/strong&gt; - Mint only supports importing up to 3
    months of transaction data per account. Some institutions provide
    less than that. Obviously Intuit doesn&amp;#8217;t want people switching from
    their paid software, so the two &lt;span class="caps"&gt;YEARS&lt;/span&gt; of transactions I meticulously
    categorized in Quicken are now useless to me in Mint. However, I
    guess I can&amp;#8217;t really fault them too much on this one. Firstly, that
    would be a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LOT&lt;/span&gt; of data for them to store. It would also be much more
    of a headache to try and ensure that the export formats of whatever
    software packages they support are properly&amp;nbsp;parsed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mint does a lot of things well. And it&amp;#8217;s a nice clean interface. But
there are also some key features missing, which I feel like I really
need. So, for the time being, I&amp;#8217;m going to keep using mint, but also
explore what other options are available, and look into anyone who
offers an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; for pulling transaction data that might actually be
powerful enough for me to use to write my own web-based app (since my
attempts at pulling &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OFX"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;OFX&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; feeds only
worked for about half my accounts). If you don&amp;#8217;t care as much about
tracking cash spending/cash on hand, and are financially stable enough
that you don&amp;#8217;t need to forecast the next month or two, Mint is&amp;nbsp;wonderful.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">admin</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 03 Jul 2011 22:03:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:blog.jasonantman.com,2011-07-03:2011/07/a-quick-review-of-mint-com-from-both-a-user-and-programmer-perspective/</guid><category>finance</category><category>mint</category><category>review</category></item><item><title>Links for Wednesday, June 8, 2011</title><link>http://blog.jasonantman.com/2011/06/links-for-wednesday-june-8-2011/</link><description>&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;big&lt;/strong&gt; issue these days, and one that&amp;#8217;s exploded out of the geek
circles into mainstream media. I&amp;#8217;ll admit that it seems like there are
endless variations on exactly what people consider Net Neutrality to be
(or what it &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be). The general goal of Net Neutrality is to
ensure that Internet Service Providers (ISPs) provide (relatively)
unfiltered access to the Internet to their customers. Specifically, that
if a given customer pays for a level of service - i.e. 10 Mbps
downstream speed and 2.5 Mbps upstream speed - they receive that speed
no matter what they are accessing. The goal of Net Neutrality is to
require ISPs to treat their connections as a &amp;#8220;common carrier&amp;#8221;, much like
telephone companies or freight trucks. Within reason (excepting
explosives and other hazardous materials), &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UPS&lt;/span&gt; will ship a package for a
given rate based only on what it weighs and how far it&amp;#8217;s going (since
the Internet is run by many companies, and data passes from one to
another, the distance portion of this analogy is constant). They don&amp;#8217;t
charge more based on what&amp;#8217;s in the box, and they don&amp;#8217;t ship come boxes
faster than others based simply on who sent it or what&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;inside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Likewise, over the past century, many laws have been created that
regulate the telephone industry. While there was a time when customers
had to rent their telephones from the phone company, long-standing
legislation states that a customer can hook any properly functioning
device into the phone network, and a customer can say whatever they want
over the phone and receive the same call quality, at the same&amp;nbsp;rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To try and summarize, the goal of Net Neutrality is to ensure that you,
the customer of an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISP&lt;/span&gt; (whether cable, FiOS, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DSL&lt;/span&gt;, etc.), is entitled to
certain rights. Generally (the exact interpretation of this concept
varies) this&amp;nbsp;includes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The ability to connect any device you want to your Internet
    connection - any computer, game console, or other device, running
    any operating system or other&amp;nbsp;software.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your ability to connect to any service (web site, protocol, etc.)
    that you want without it being intentionally degraded or slowed
    down, even if it&amp;#8217;s a service viewed to be a competitor of your&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISP&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your ability to transfer data to and from any other user of the
    Internet, regardless of who they&amp;nbsp;are.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What could happen if Net Neutrality isn&amp;#8217;t&amp;nbsp;enforced?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me first say that most of the following is pure speculation. These
are things that &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; happen, but most have not yet actually been
done. Some have. The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISP&lt;/span&gt; industry seems to say that Net Neutrality is &amp;#8220;a
solution without a problem&amp;#8221;, but my personal view is that those are
generally good things. Preventing a problem from occurring is generally
better than fixing it after it&amp;#8217;s a problem. So here are a few scenarios
of what could happen if Net Neutrality isn&amp;#8217;t properly legislated and&amp;nbsp;enforced:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Companies like Cablevision, Comcast, Verizon, and other major ISPs
    also offer &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TV&lt;/span&gt; services (Optimum, FiOS &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TV&lt;/span&gt;, etc.) that include Video
    On Demand (VoD) as a separate paid service. Websites like Hulu and
    Netflix offer the same service, for free or a much cheaper rate.
    Without Net Neutrality, your &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISP&lt;/span&gt; could intentionally slow down or
    block sites like Hulu or Netflix to force you to buy their more
    expensive service. Comcast has &lt;a href="http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9198498/Comcast_demands_fees_for_Web_movie_viewing_Level_3_says"&gt;already
    tried&lt;/a&gt;
    to do something like this, asking Netflix&amp;#8217;s &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISP&lt;/span&gt; for a substantial
    fee to allow Comcast customers to access Netfix (that&amp;#8217;s a bit of an
    oversimplification, but gets the point). If this happens, it&amp;#8217;s most
    likely that Netfix will have to increase their fees substantially.
    Net Neutrality legislation would require ISPs like Comcast to treat
    all Internet traffic the same, whether it&amp;#8217;s from Netflix, Facebook,
    or my humble little&amp;nbsp;blog.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A few ISPs (mainly Comcast) have already tried all-out blocking Peer
    to Peer (p2p) file sharing traffic such as bitTorrent, Kazaa, etc.
    While they cite copyright infringement as the reason, there are many
    people who use p2p file sharing to distribute legal files, such as
    the Linux operating system and other free software. Blocking all p2p
    traffic because some people use it for illegal purposes is based on
    a presumption of guilt, no different from outlawing steak knives
    because some people stab other people with&amp;nbsp;them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Throughout the history of the Internet, some of the most popular and
    innovative technologies, including Google, Facebook, etc. have
    started out as small projects run by a few geeks and programmers. If
    ISPs were allowed to charge content providers (i.e. websites) to be
    viewed by the ISPs customers, it would limit innovation and new
    technologies to only the big businesses with enough money to pay
    these artificial&amp;nbsp;tolls.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most ISPs also offer a phone service. It would be trivial for them
    to flat-out prevent their customers from using Vonage, Skype, iChat,
    etc. and force you to subscribe to their service. It&amp;#8217;s also possible
    for them to do this in a covert way - when Comcast blocked
    bitTorrent users, they did it in a way so clever that it took weeks
    for experts to figure&amp;nbsp;out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Without a mandate that any suitable device can connect to the
    network, your &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISP&lt;/span&gt; could partner with, for example, Dell and
    Microsoft, and say that you could only get Internet access on a Dell
    computer running the latest version of Windows (yes, this is a bit
    of a stretch, but possible in an unregulated &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISP&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;market).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The important fact to note here is that most people in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; don&amp;#8217;t have
much choice in terms of broadband ISPs - generally the only &amp;#8220;choice&amp;#8221; is
between the cable and phone companies, who provide more or less the same
service. With such limited choice, Internet users are effectively held
hostage by the policies of a handful of companies that control Internet&amp;nbsp;access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A short note on the History of the&amp;nbsp;Internet&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contrary to the ISPs &amp;#8220;solution without a problem&amp;#8221; view, I think this is
a solution that should have been implemented long ago. The network that
evolved into what we now know as the Internet, in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt;, was first
developed in the 1970s. The project, ARPAnet, was developed by the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt;
government for research purposes, and funded by taxpayer money. It
wasn&amp;#8217;t opened to commercial use until the early 1990s, when it was
privatized. While the development into what is now the Internet could
never have been foreseen at that time, Net Neutrality rules should have
been built in from the start when the project was handed over from the
federal government to the private sector. Regardless, it must be
remembered that the Internet is a technology that was originally
developed with taxpayer funds, for the country as a&amp;nbsp;whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FCC&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;doing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, in short, not much. It appears that the Net Neutrality rules
delivered by the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FCC&lt;/span&gt; earlier this week are, more than anything, a
compromise effort to make the issue just &amp;#8220;go away&amp;#8221;. The ISPs feel that
the rules aren&amp;#8217;t needed (and argue that the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FCC&lt;/span&gt; doesn&amp;#8217;t have the power
to make them), and most Net Neutrality proponents feel that the rules
pay only lip service to the goals of Net Neutrality. The main failings
already apparent in the rules&amp;nbsp;are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Two of three major parts of the rules ignore wireless ISPs (cellular
    carriers). With the explosion of smartphones, it seems that wireless
    is not only the new frontier of the Internet, but the way that more
    and more people get Internet access. If Net Neutrality is
    legislated, it should be about the Internet - regardless of how a
    customer is connected to the&amp;nbsp;network.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is a provision for ISPs to be able to block or slow down
    traffic as is &amp;#8220;reasonable&amp;#8221; to operate their network, but there are
    no guidelines on what &amp;#8220;reasonable&amp;#8221; means, and it seems that the
    burden of proof would be on the customer to fight their &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISP&lt;/span&gt; in court
    and show that something was&amp;nbsp;unreasonable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Up until very recently, ISPs generally didn&amp;#8217;t engage in the kind of
conduct that Net Neutrality rules would prohibit. The Internet as we
know it today is a product of a world with unwritten Net Neutrality
rules. Amazing sites and services like Facebook, Google, Twitter, and
many others started as experiments by a few dedicated people with little
to no budget. The fact that you can easily view web pages created by
anyone - like my blog - would be ended if website publishers had to pay
ISPs to be allowed through. The choice that you have in using your &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISP&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TV&lt;/span&gt; or phone service, or something like Netflix or Vonage, is central to
the Internet as we know it, but is under attack. I know that many people
look at this as a &amp;#8220;problem for the geeks&amp;#8221;. We take the Internet for
granted. Over the next few days, every time you visit a web site or use
an Internet-based service, ask yourself: Would I be happy if I had to
pay for this? Would this even exist if the people who designed it had to
pay from day one? Make no mistake, if websites have to pay every &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISP&lt;/span&gt; in
the country to be viewed, the days of wonderful free services sustained
by advertising revenue only will be long&amp;nbsp;gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In closing, I highly recommend reading an &lt;a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2010/12/steve-wozniak-to-the-fcc-keep-the-internet-free/68294/"&gt;open letter on Net Neutrality

(build &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ESD56&lt;/span&gt;, baseband C_01.3E.01P) with SPRecovery 0.99.2b. Well
yesterday I for the random deletion of all &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SMS&lt;/span&gt; bug again, and I decided
it&amp;#8217;s time to upgrade. I never upgraded to 2.1 - mainly out of laziness.
When it first came out, nobody had a patched update.zip yet to preserve
root. When I looked back into the situation a few weeks ago (when
Froyo/2.2 came out), I found that pretty much the whole community had
moved from patched update.zip&amp;#8217;s to full &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ROM&lt;/span&gt; images. I didn&amp;#8217;t want to
lose my apps, data, settings, etc. and couldn&amp;#8217;t find any instructions
that didn&amp;#8217;t include a wipe/reset, so I decided to keep putting it&amp;nbsp;off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, after yesterday&amp;#8217;s bug (and after I played with the Camera app on
an Incredible and saw how much nicer it is), I decided it was time to
bite the bullet and move to &lt;a href="http://www.cyanogenmod.com/"&gt;CyanogenMod&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ROMS&lt;/span&gt;. I performed the upgrade this morning, and it seems to have worked
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt;, though I haven&amp;#8217;t been using the phone very much since it&amp;nbsp;finished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rooted 2.0.1 to CyanogenMod 2.2&amp;nbsp;procedure:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m starting with a Motorola Droid, 2.0.1 (build &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ESD56&lt;/span&gt;), rooted,
baseband C_01.3E.01P, with SPRecovery&amp;nbsp;0.99.2b&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perform full Nandroid backup through&amp;nbsp;SPRecovery.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run &lt;a href="market://search?q=com.riteshsahu.CallLogBackupRestore"&gt;Call Logs Backup &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;
    Restore&lt;/a&gt;
    (v1.8) to backup call&amp;nbsp;log.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run &lt;a href="market://search?q=com.riteshsahu.SMSBackupRestore"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SMS&lt;/span&gt; Backup &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;
    Restore&lt;/a&gt; (v3.4)
    to backup &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SMS&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run &lt;a href="market://search?q=com.boots.MyAppsList"&gt;MyAppsList&lt;/a&gt; to make a
    list of all installed apps as &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt;, including market links. Save to
    &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SD&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;card.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run &lt;a href="market://search?q=com.happydroid.bookmarks"&gt;Bookmark Sort &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Backup
    Free&lt;/a&gt; to backup
    bookmarks to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SD&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;card.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run &lt;a href="market://search?q=com.metago.astro"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ASTRO&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; file manager and
    backup &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ALL&lt;/span&gt; apps to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SD&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;card.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mount the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SD&lt;/span&gt; card on another computer and copy all the backups you
    just made to somewhere&amp;nbsp;safe.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the rest of the procedure, I more or less followed the &lt;a href="http://wiki.cyanogenmod.com/index.php?title=Full_Update_Guide_-_Motorola_Droid"&gt;CyanogenMod
Droid Full
Update&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;guide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buy &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; install &lt;a href="market://search?q=com.koushikdutta.rommanager"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ROM&lt;/span&gt;
    Manager&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;Premium.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flash ClockworkMod&amp;nbsp;Recovery.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ROM&lt;/span&gt; Manager to backup current &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ROM&lt;/span&gt; to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SD&lt;/span&gt; card, copy the backup
    somewhere safe on another&amp;nbsp;computer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ROM&lt;/span&gt; Manager - download CyanogenMod 6.0.0 for Droid with AWDLauncher
    and Google&amp;nbsp;Apps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check off &amp;#8220;wipe data and cache&amp;#8221;, click&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Phone reboots into recovery, flashes new image, and boots to
    CyanogenMod Froyo (2.2, build &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FRG22D&lt;/span&gt;), still has baseband&amp;nbsp;C_01.3E.01P.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enter your Google account information to begin sync. Your Google
    data (calendar, contacts, etc.) should be synced as well as all of
    your Market apps. You will, however, lose all of your app&amp;nbsp;settings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Post-Upgrade:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the upgrade, there were a few things I had to do, and a few issues
that I wasn&amp;#8217;t prepared for. Here&amp;#8217;s a list of them, and the solutions I
found (if any) in no particular&amp;nbsp;order&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Restore bookmarks, call log, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SMS&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;backup.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All of my per-contact ringtones were gone. As far as I could find,
    there&amp;#8217;s no known good way of backing up and restoring&amp;nbsp;these.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I obviously lost the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HD&lt;/span&gt;-quality video hack I&amp;#8217;d applied to the Droid,
    as well as anything else I&amp;#8217;d done in the boot settings&amp;nbsp;file.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I apparently lost the following apps (not restored when the phone
    synced with&amp;nbsp;Google):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="market://search?q=com.ztech.packagetracking"&gt;Package&amp;nbsp;Tracking&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="market://search?q=com.googlecode.pythonforandroid"&gt;Python for&amp;nbsp;Android&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="market://search?q=com.googlecode.android_scripting"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SL4A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="market://search?q=com.mahoney.tetronimo"&gt;Tetronimo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following apps were added by CyanogenMod (or are new since&amp;nbsp;2.0.1):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""&gt;Chrome to Phone&lt;/a&gt; -
    &lt;a href="http://code.google.com/p/chrometophone/"&gt;chrometophone&lt;/a&gt; - send
    links from Chrome browser to your phone using some Google
    messaging&amp;nbsp;service&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""&gt;Dev Tools&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;-&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""&gt;DPSManager&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;-&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""&gt;News and&amp;nbsp;Weather&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""&gt;Places&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/04/introducing-google-places.html"&gt;Google&amp;nbsp;Places&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""&gt;Spare Parts&lt;/a&gt; - apparently allows access to some settings not
    available through the Settings&amp;nbsp;menu&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""&gt;Speech&amp;nbsp;Recorder&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""&gt;Superuser&lt;/a&gt; - App to graphically manage root&amp;nbsp;access&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""&gt;Talk&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/talk/"&gt;Google&amp;nbsp;Talk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""&gt;Terminal Emulator&lt;/a&gt; (somehow I have two&amp;nbsp;installed&amp;#8230;?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""&gt;Videos&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""&gt;Voice&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/mobile/voice/"&gt;Google Voice&amp;nbsp;mobile&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These apps had data associated with them which was somewhat
    important (I wrote the script below to handle the&amp;nbsp;move):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""&gt;Alarm Clock&amp;nbsp;Plus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""&gt;Barnacle WiFi&amp;nbsp;Tether&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""&gt;ConnectBot&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""&gt;gReader&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""&gt;Jewles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""&gt;Nagroid&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Had to re-set my notification sounds - Flutey Phone for incoming
    calls, Look at Me for messaging and Highwire for other&amp;nbsp;notifications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Much to my pleasure, my WiFi settings, saved networks, etc.
    magically came back. Haven&amp;#8217;t checked bluetooth&amp;nbsp;yet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I had to change my voicemail number (Settings -&gt; Call Settings -&gt;
    Voicemail Settings) to automatically wait and enter my&amp;nbsp;password.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the moment, this script is obviously setup to do one app at a time,
hard-coded in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;APP&lt;/span&gt; variable. It also assumes that the app data
directory is stored at&amp;nbsp;/sdcard/restore/$&lt;span class="caps"&gt;APP&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilite"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="c"&gt;#!/bin/bash&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nv"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;APP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;com.vp.alarmClockPlusDock&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nv"&gt;BIN_PATH&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;/system/xbin/&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;DATA_PATH&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;/data/data/&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;BACKUP_PATH&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;PERMS_PATH&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;/data/system/packages.list&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nv"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;OWNER&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sb"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;grep -i &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;$&lt;span class="caps"&gt;APP&lt;/span&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; /data/system/packages.list | awk &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;{ print $2}&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sb"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nb"&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;OWNER&lt;/span&gt;=$&lt;span class="caps"&gt;OWNER&lt;/span&gt;=&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ll update this now and then as I have more to add to&amp;nbsp;it&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">admin</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 04 Sep 2010 16:50:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:blog.jasonantman.com,2010-09-04:2010/09/motorola-droid-rooted-2-0-1-to-rooted-2-2-cyanogenmod/</guid><category>android</category><category>cyanogen</category><category>cyanogenmod</category><category>droid</category><category>root</category></item><item><title>Mediawiki Extension - Section Link To Top</title><link>http://blog.jasonantman.com/2010/08/mediawiki-extension-section-link-to-top/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;While working on a particularly long documentation page in MediaWiki

computers. Today I left a few tabs open in Firefox on my work laptop,
and wanted to continue reading from my desktop. Normally I&amp;#8217;d just grab
the laptop, or &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RDP&lt;/span&gt; into it if it was my work desktop that had the open
tabs, but at the moment my girlfriend is neck-deep in WoW on the
MacBook. Having had this problem before (getting tabs back remotely, not
a laptop occupied with WoW), I started thinking about a&amp;nbsp;solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; have closed my local firefox session, moved the
sessionstore.js somewhere else, copied the one from the laptop over,
re-opened firefox, &amp;#8230; well, you get the&amp;nbsp;idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that sounds like a really sub-optimal solution. So I started looking
around a bit. It seems that sessionstore.js is &lt;em&gt;almost&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JSON&lt;/span&gt;, but as per
&lt;a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=407110#c2"&gt;Mozilla bug
407110&lt;/a&gt;, it&amp;#8217;s
not quite standards-compliant. Luckily, it seems that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JSON&lt;/span&gt; module
is quite tolerant, so once I stripped off the leading and trailing
parens from the file contents, it parsed quite&amp;nbsp;nicely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve written a small &lt;code&gt;dumpFirefoxSession.php&lt;/code&gt; script that reads the
sessionstore.js file (in cwd or a specified path), unserializes the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JSON&lt;/span&gt;
as an array, and then dumps the tabs. It dumps as either plain text or
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt; (currently just elements inside the body, not a full &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt; file).
The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt; will include &lt;code&gt;ol&lt;/code&gt;s for each window listing the tabs, links to
the current content (sessionstore.js also holds history for each tab,
but I don&amp;#8217;t need this), and it shows which tab is currently&amp;nbsp;selected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can grab the script from github at:
&lt;a href="https://github.com/jantman/misc-scripts/blob/master/nmap-xml-to-table.php"&gt;https://github.com/jantman/misc-scripts/blob/master/nmap-xml-to-table.php&lt;/a&gt;.
The current version is 3. You&amp;#8217;ll need &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt; (probably 5) with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JSON&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;support.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">admin</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 17 Aug 2010 21:17:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:blog.jasonantman.com,2010-08-17:2010/08/php-script-to-dump-firefox-session/</guid><category>firefox</category><category>PHP</category></item><item><title>My Droid Rooting Dilemma</title><link>http://blog.jasonantman.com/2010/08/my-droid-rooting-dilemma/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;My Droid is still running 2.0.1 rooted, with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SPS&lt;/span&gt; Recovery, just as it
was the week the 2.0.1 update was pushed out &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OTA&lt;/span&gt; - I&amp;#8217;d already rooted
it, disabled &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OTA&lt;/span&gt; updates, and performed a simple procedure to update and
keep&amp;nbsp;root.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My one complaint is that - as always happens with a new and cool
technology that gets widely adopted - it seems like the Android
community is being, well, dumbed down. When I first rooted my Droid, it
involved using the adb shell. Now, it&amp;#8217;s hard to find instructions that
aren&amp;#8217;t written exclusively for Windows - or even instructions that
actually explain what I&amp;#8217;m supposed to be doing or why it&amp;nbsp;works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know that I haven&amp;#8217;t followed the Android world much lately, but it
seems to me that this should be really simple. The update.zip &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OTA&lt;/span&gt;
updates are just patches. I already have the device rooted on 2.0.1,
have disabled &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OTA&lt;/span&gt; updates, etc. So it seems to me that I should be able
to just unzip the update file, change whatever needs to be changed to
keep root, re-zip it, and upload it. If it wasn&amp;#8217;t already done (the
HowTo that I followed to update to rooted 2.0.1 doesn&amp;#8217;t seem to be
online anymore, and I can&amp;#8217;t find the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt;), I should be able to just
change the update verification keys to accept&amp;nbsp;anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I guess it&amp;#8217;s time to continue my hours of research and see if I
can come up with anything. Everything I&amp;#8217;ve already found says that I
have to backup all of my apps and data and just flash a new &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ROM&lt;/span&gt;, but
that seems stupid. Why can&amp;#8217;t I just make use of this wonderful
patch-based updating and keep&amp;nbsp;root?&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">admin</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 16 Aug 2010 09:14:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:blog.jasonantman.com,2010-08-16:2010/08/my-droid-rooting-dilemma/</guid><category>android</category><category>droid</category><category>root</category></item><item><title>Updated Android App List</title><link>http://blog.jasonantman.com/2010/08/updated-android-app-list/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s the current list of the apps that are running on my Droid and
seem interesting (I&amp;#8217;m still running 2.0.1, build &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ESD56&lt;/span&gt;). This is an
update to my earlier post, &lt;a href="/2010/02/my-android-apps/"&gt;My Android Apps&lt;/a&gt;,
so I left out everything that was already in that&amp;nbsp;post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This list was generated with
&lt;a href="market://search?q=com.boots.MyAppsList"&gt;MyAppsList&lt;/a&gt;, though I did
massage it a bit after generation (mainly because it copied text that
was all on &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; line, though it does output &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt; with market links and
the apps in li elements). The simple script to make the output a little
more blog-friendly&amp;nbsp;is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilite"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;cat apps.txt | sed &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;s/&amp;lt;\/li&amp;gt;/&amp;lt;\/li&amp;gt;  &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="s1"&gt;/g&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; | sed &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;s///g&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; | sed &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;s/&amp;lt;\/font&amp;gt;//g&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; | sed &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;s///g&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    Just got this, still figuring it out, but appears to be a &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt;
    nicer messaging app with popups (including reply box) for incoming
    &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SMS&lt;/span&gt;, nicer view,&amp;nbsp;etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="market://search?q=com.vzw.hss.myverizon"&gt;My Verizon Mobile&lt;/a&gt; (v5.0)&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Verizon&amp;#8217;s app that shows your current monthly minute, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SMS&lt;/span&gt;, and
data usage, as well as other&amp;nbsp;stuff.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

    App used to generate this&amp;nbsp;list.&lt;/li&gt;

    (v1.9b) - Simple package tracking for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UPS&lt;/span&gt;, FedEx, etc. Unfortunately
    it doesn&amp;#8217;t provide any notifications and it only remembers one
    tracking number at a&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="market://search?q=com.pdanet"&gt;PdaNet&lt;/a&gt; (v2.42) - &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USB&lt;/span&gt; or Bluetooth
    tethering (official client software is Mac and Windows&amp;nbsp;only).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="market://search?q=com.mm.network"&gt;Ping&lt;/a&gt; (v1.6.9) - Ping&amp;nbsp;app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="market://search?q=com.googlecode.pythonforandroid"&gt;Python for
    Android&lt;/a&gt; (v0) -
    Python interpreter for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SL4A&lt;/span&gt;. So far, it doesn&amp;#8217;t seem to be able to
    do too much in my&amp;nbsp;opinion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="market://search?q=com.biggu.shopsavvy"&gt;ShopSavvy&lt;/a&gt; (v3.6.6) - Scan a
    bar code, see the lowest prices for that product both online and in
    local&amp;nbsp;stores.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="market://search?q=com.googlecode.android_scripting"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SL4A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (v0) -
    Scripting environment for Android with pluggable interpreters. So
    far, it seems to be missing a lot of Android classes that would make
    it useful for doing device-specific things (like listing installed&amp;nbsp;apps).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="market://search?q=com.javacodeland.android.voicememo"&gt;VoiceMemo&lt;/a&gt;
    (v1.0.1) - Simple voice memo app. I use it quite a bit, but there&amp;#8217;s
    no simple way to email SMSes, it only titles them by date and time
    recorded, and it doesn&amp;#8217;t keep the phone awake (recordings seem
    limited to 60 seconds or&amp;nbsp;so).&lt;/li&gt;

small group that mainly provides services. We run wireless and student
computing labs across a whole campus, but other than that (and most of
that) is just back-end systems - web servers, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RADIUS&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DHCP&lt;/span&gt;, etc. As a
result, I write no end-user documentation. I generally think of this as
a blessing, since the people who read my documentation are people who
think (more or less) like&amp;nbsp;me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I&amp;#8217;ve just started writing the wiki page for a rather large
system I developed. And in writing the docs, and thinking about what was
missing from the (practically non-existent) documentation on the system
I was replacing, it got me thinking a lot about the documentation
writing process. Most of us have heard that there are two general types
of documentation - end-user docs and developer (and I&amp;#8217;m rolling SysAdmin
in here) documentation. End-user docs tell someone how to use what we
built. Developer docs tell people how to troubleshoot, fix, modify, and
extend it.&amp;nbsp;Usually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there&amp;#8217;s one very important piece that&amp;#8217;s missing from most
developer-level documentation I&amp;#8217;ve read: why it&amp;#8217;s built the way it is.
Sure, this isn&amp;#8217;t applicable in all instances. This is obviously ignored
by closed-source software developers when writing documentation for
release. And I&amp;#8217;m sure it&amp;#8217;s ignored in some larger shops just out of fear
that the interns will explain why they need to iterate a database result
set. But for those of us who are designing and building systems, I&amp;#8217;d
argue that documenting the reasons behind our decisions is much more
important than how-to-fix-it or how-to-rebuild-it documentation. Sure,
it&amp;#8217;s atrocious practice, but that can all be gleaned from examining a
live system or backups. But when it comes time for the next person (or
you or I, five years down the road) to re-design or drastically modify
our creations, some documentation of the decisions we made - and the
reasoning behind them - will be extremely&amp;nbsp;useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Case in point: My latest project started as performance analysis of a
large &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DHCP&lt;/span&gt; server using the &lt;a href="http://personal.cfw.com/~masneyb/"&gt;Masney &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LDAP&lt;/span&gt;
patch&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="http://www.isc.org/software/dhcp"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISC&lt;/span&gt;
DHCPd&lt;/a&gt;. After over a week of
performance testing and trying different configurations and theories
(all of which I &amp;#8220;documented&amp;#8221; in my text file lab notebook), we ended up
deciding to totally remove &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LDAP&lt;/span&gt; from the system, move to configuration
files generated from MySQL, and keep everything (including the logs) in
ramdisk. We found performance bottlenecks in both the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LDAP&lt;/span&gt; communication
and disk &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IO&lt;/span&gt;. We have the performance test output to prove it. We have
the results of dozens of tests with different configurations, as well as
a number of problems we identified with the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LDAP&lt;/span&gt; patch. And from
testing, we have a handful of issues identified and fixed in the new
system, whose fixes aren&amp;#8217;t exactly&amp;nbsp;intuitive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The previous system had pretty poor documentation, but even worse, it
was only functional documentation - what the system does, and how it
does it. There was no discussion of why the parsing script disregarded
lines with a certain string in them, why the daemon is restarted every
night, why &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LDAP&lt;/span&gt; was chosen in the first place, or any performance
metrics (so we had no original as-intended baseline to compare&amp;nbsp;against).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So for those of you designing systems and documenting them (you *do*
document them, &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt;?), please include &lt;strong&gt;why&lt;/strong&gt; in your documentation.
The next time someone needs to fix or tweak or re-engineer the system,
they&amp;#8217;ll be able to figure out what happens on line 123 of the init
script themselves. But it might take them hours to figure out &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; it&amp;#8217;s
done, or &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; it&amp;#8217;s done &lt;em&gt;that way&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">admin</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 06 Aug 2010 14:51:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:blog.jasonantman.com,2010-08-06:2010/08/putting-the-why-in-documentation/</guid><category>documentation</category><category>sysadmin</category></item><item><title>Short Update</title><link>http://blog.jasonantman.com/2010/08/short-update/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Just a short update&amp;#8230; I know I haven&amp;#8217;t posted anything in quite a
while, but I hope to get back into the habit of doing so&amp;#8230; or even
making daily posts like I had&amp;nbsp;wanted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href="/2010/05/truck-totaled/"&gt;truck that was totaled&lt;/a&gt; has been
    replaced with a newer, nicer&amp;nbsp;one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve spent most of the past month working on a large &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DHCP&lt;/span&gt; project at
    work, which I hope to write about in depth at some&amp;nbsp;point.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I bought the parts to make an Arduino-based &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OBD&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;II&lt;/span&gt; display, and I&amp;#8217;m
    slowly making some progress on it (mostly delayed because the $12

less time there every time they make an &amp;#8220;improvement&amp;#8221;), I guess I should
give in and post something to my usually-so-professional blog,
explaining a bit about what happened to my

&lt;a href="/2009/02/truck-wiring-and-lighting-part-i/"&gt;truck&lt;/a&gt;, which I&amp;#8217;d put so
much &lt;a href="/2009/02/custom-truck-console/"&gt;work&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;into.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two weeks ago - 08:43 on Saturday, May 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt;, 2010 - I was involved in a
&amp;#8220;bit&amp;#8221; of an accident with my truck while driving down to my dad&amp;#8217;s place
in Hunterdon county. I was &lt;a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.017828,-74.217229&amp;amp;num=1&amp;amp;t=h&amp;amp;sll=41.018107,-74.218228&amp;amp;sspn=0.007026,0.016512&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;ll=41.017834,-74.217217&amp;amp;spn=0.007026,0.016512&amp;amp;z=17"&gt;on 208
Northbound&lt;/a&gt;
in Franklin Lakes right across from the Colonial Rd intersection (maybe
8 minutes from home?), early in the morning. I really don&amp;#8217;t have any
desire to tell the &lt;em&gt;whole detailed&lt;/em&gt; story again, but bottom like: there
were three geese crossing the highway, and someone got the brilliant
idea to rapidly decelerate from 60 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MPH&lt;/span&gt; to allow the birds to safely
cross. I still can&amp;#8217;t provide for the account of where every vehicle on
the road went, but there was a half-second of various drivers making
evasive maneuvers, me jamming on the brake and horn, and my truck having
a fast introduction to the ass-end of a box&amp;nbsp;truck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily nobody was injured, though I did have neck pain for a day or two
after. The guy who decided to stop/cut left (in front of the box truck)
drove happily off into the sunrise, the guy in a blacked out &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SUV&lt;/span&gt; who had
been between the box truck and my vehicle (obscuring most of the truck
from my view) also, as far as I know, departed. Once I got the airbags
out of my way and the door kicked open, my former vehicle was on its way
to the body&amp;nbsp;shop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I must say, while I had an absolutely horrendous experience with
&lt;a href="http://www.geico.com"&gt;geico&lt;/a&gt; when this same vehicle was stolen a year
and a half ago, they were actually pretty good this time around. The
accident happened on a Sunday, I took Monday off of work to get a rental
car and deal with the claim (yeah, it turns out my policy didn&amp;#8217;t have
the rental coverage, much to my surprise&amp;#8230;) and the claims agent came
out Tuesday (less than 48 hours after the accident) to make an estimate.
He totaled the truck - the motor was even broken loose of all of the
mounts - and I had a check in my hand (minus the balance of the
financing) 12 days after the accident. So&amp;#8230; my experience with Geico
this time around was much better. I guess as long as there&amp;#8217;s a vehicle
for them to look at, they&amp;#8217;re happy. Though I&amp;#8217;m switching to Progressive
for the next&amp;nbsp;vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, that&amp;#8217;s the story. Assuming Enterprise car rental is playing nice,
I&amp;#8217;ll be picking up the truck I just bought tomorrow&amp;nbsp;morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href="http://www.sage.org/lists/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SAGE&lt;/span&gt;-members&lt;/a&gt; list
(&lt;a href="http://mailman.sage.org/pipermail/sage-members/2010/msg00788.html"&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt;)
and to
&lt;a href="http://serverfault.com/questions/136416/free-web-based-software-for-team-collaboration-documentation"&gt;ServerFault&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking for some advice here, as my search has turned up to be pretty&amp;nbsp;fruitless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My group (9 people - SAs, programmers, and two network guys) is
looking for some sort of web tool to&amp;#8230; ahem&amp;#8230; &amp;#8220;facilitate increased
collaboration&amp;#8221; (we didn&amp;#8217;t use a buzzword generator, I swear). At the
moment, we have an unified ticketing system that&amp;#8217;s braindead, but is
here to stay for political/logistical reasons. We&amp;#8217;ve got 2 wikis
(&amp;#8220;old&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;new&amp;#8221;), neither of which fulfill our needs, and are
therefore not used very often. We&amp;#8217;re looking for a free (as in both
cost and open source) web-based&amp;nbsp;tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Management side:&lt;br /&gt;
 Wants to be able to track project status, who&amp;#8217;s doing what, whether
deadlines are being met, etc. Doesn&amp;#8217;t want full-fledged &amp;#8220;project
management&amp;#8221; app, just something where we can update &amp;#8220;yeah this was
done&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;waiting for Bob to configure the widgets&amp;#8221;.
&lt;a href="http://www.teambox.com"&gt;TeamBox&lt;/a&gt; was suggested, but it seems almost
too gimmicky (Twitter/Facebook ripoff?), and doesn&amp;#8217;t seem to meet any
of the other requirements that I see coming&amp;nbsp;up:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Non-management side:&lt;br /&gt;
 - flexible, powerful wiki for all documentation (i.e. includes good
tables, easy markup, syntax highlighting, etc.)&lt;br /&gt;
 - good full text search of everything (i.e. type in a hostname and
get every instance anyone ever uttered that name)&lt;br /&gt;
 - task lists or ToDo lists, hopefully about to be grouped into a
number of &amp;#8220;projects&amp;#8221;&lt;br /&gt;
 - file uploads&lt;br /&gt;
 - &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RSS&lt;/span&gt; or Atom feeds, email alerts of&amp;nbsp;updates&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;re open to doing some customizations (adding some features,
notification/feeds, searching, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SVN&lt;/span&gt; integration, etc.) but need
something F/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;OSS&lt;/span&gt; that will run under&amp;nbsp;Apache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My conundrum is that most of the choices I&amp;#8217;ve found so far fall into
one of these categories:&lt;br /&gt;
 - project management/task tracking with poor
wiki/documentation/knowledge base support&lt;br /&gt;
 - wiki with no task tracking support&lt;br /&gt;
 - ticketing system with everything else bolted on (we already have
one that we&amp;#8217;re stuck with)&lt;br /&gt;
 - code-centric application (we do little &amp;#8220;development&amp;#8221;, mostly &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SA&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;work)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any&amp;nbsp;suggestions?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or, lacking that, any comments on which software would be easiest to
add the lacking features to (hopefully ending up with something that
actually looks good and works&amp;nbsp;well)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m still awaiting responses from both &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SAGE&lt;/span&gt; and ServerFault, but I have
a strong feeling that most of the suggestions will fall into one of the
major categories I already identified,&amp;nbsp;mainly:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Project management/task tracking with poor wiki/documentation
    support (a la&amp;nbsp;TeamBox)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wiki with no task tracking&amp;nbsp;support&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ticketing system with everything else added in (useless since we
    already have to use a different ticketing&amp;nbsp;system).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Something code-centric, i.e. built around a software development
    workflow, which isn&amp;#8217;t&amp;nbsp;us.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I have a very strong feeling that whatever solution we end up going
with, we&amp;#8217;ll need to spend quite a bit of time bolting on whatever else
we need. Adding a full-featured wiki to another package isn&amp;#8217;t going to
be very easy&amp;#8230; especially since TeamBox is written in RoR, and we&amp;#8217;re
mostly &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;guys.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">admin</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 27 Apr 2010 16:43:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:blog.jasonantman.com,2010-04-27:2010/04/web-based-collaborationdocumentation-software/</guid><category>collaboration</category><category>documentation</category><category>project management</category><category>Projects</category><category>wiki</category></item><item><title>What is System Administration?</title><link>http://blog.jasonantman.com/2010/04/what-is-system-administration/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I was recently reading an interesting article, &amp;#8220;from tasks to
assurances: redefining system administration&amp;#8221;, by &lt;a href="http://www.cs.tufts.edu/~couch/"&gt;Alva L.
Couch&lt;/a&gt;, in the April 2010 issue of
&lt;a href="http://www.usenix.org/publications/login/"&gt;;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;LOGIN&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/a&gt;. He makes a lot of
good points, mainly that system administration has been defined by
tasks, but should really be defined by assurances (a much more abstract
concept). This does make a lot more sense, and perhaps will aid me in
finally coming up with a succinct (but complete) answer for when people
ask me what I&amp;nbsp;do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It bears mention that my role as an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SA&lt;/span&gt; probably isn&amp;#8217;t the same as many
others. Working at a University has its perks - and one is definitely
the inclination towards research, tinkering, and trying new things.
Another is the extremely tight budget - I&amp;#8217;d estimate that only about 25%
of what my group supports (software-wise) actually has a vendor behind
it. Most of those services have primary admins assigned to&amp;nbsp;them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group I work in is composed of 9 people (including myself). We&amp;#8217;re
responsible for the architecture (specifically authentication,
network-side stuff) for residential/dorm networking (ResNet), all of the
student computing labs (\~1,000 user stations) as well as printing
therein, the University-wide wireless network (from physical
installation through support), and a few other services. That doesn&amp;#8217;t
include all of the usual ancillary stuff - mail, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DHCP&lt;/span&gt;, web apps,
storage, etc. It would probably surprise most corporate &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IT&lt;/span&gt; types that we
more or less function as an independent unit - we share certain
services, like Nagios monitoring, with other groups, but do most of our
work as a single standalone&amp;nbsp;unit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My own job (since I&amp;#8217;m currently the only part-time person in our group)
is probably &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; different from most SAs. I&amp;#8217;m the primary admin for
only one user-visible service, which is in the process of being phased
out (and is very lightly used currently). For the most part, I&amp;#8217;d
describe myself as a &amp;#8220;floating&amp;#8221; admin - I&amp;#8217;m usually assigned whatever
problems come up that are in my knowledge area (or more than the primary
admin can cram into a work week), and also do quite a bit of research
(mainly suitability analysis of new technologies). I&amp;#8217;m also the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DR&lt;/span&gt; guy,
and am in the process of implementing across the board an automated
installation, configuration, recovery and backup system for all of our
Linux/Unix boxes. As ironic as this may seem, while I&amp;#8217;m not the primary
admin for any of our major services, if one of the boxes than run them
falls over, it&amp;#8217;s more or less my responsibility to get it back up and
running. Or at least have the plans and procedures for that laid&amp;nbsp;out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something that is also quite different from many enterprise shops is our
software budget - which is almost non-existent. Except for a few
services - some of the stuff used to administer the Windows and Mac lab
machines, the printing systems, and the wireless stuff, we&amp;#8217;re pretty
much exclusively open source. As a result, there&amp;#8217;s rarely a vendor to
fall back on, and &amp;#8220;fixing a problem&amp;#8221; can often involve hours of reading&amp;nbsp;source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an aside, I once had a phone screen where the interviewer asked me
about a difficult problem I recently solved, and what my methodology
was. I ran through about 20 steps. When I finished the list, the
interviewer asked me, &amp;#8220;at what point would you call the vendor for
support?&amp;#8221; My response: &amp;#8220;vendor? what&amp;nbsp;vendor?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;#8217;m trying to think up a good answer to what I do, and what the other
SAs in my group do. There&amp;#8217;s the work in progress so&amp;nbsp;far:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We provide many different services to our users (all University
faculty, staff, students, etc.). It&amp;#8217;s my job to ensure that those
services are as reliable as possible, function correctly, are secure,
and work as well as possible. When something does fail, no matter what
it is, it&amp;#8217;s my job to get it back to normal. And when a new technology
emerges that may increase the quality, reliability or security of a
service we offer, it&amp;#8217;s my job to evaluate it and, if it is found to be
worthy, implement&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;

While I,
unfortunately, haven&amp;#8217;t planned any pranks or jokes myself this year (I
guess I&amp;#8217;ve just been too busy), I always try to find as many of
&lt;a href="http://www.google.com"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8216;s jokes as possible. Despite being a
behemoth, and raking in billions of dollars, they still seem to keep an
excellent sense of humor, both for everyone and at a very technical&amp;nbsp;level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s what I found this year (updated as I find&amp;nbsp;them):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;img alt="topeka" src="/GFX/topeka-hp.gif" /&gt;
   Google name change to Topeka - &lt;a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/04/different-kind-of-company-name.html"&gt;blog
    post&lt;/a&gt;,
    &lt;a href="http://money.cnn.com/2010/04/01/technology/google_april_fools/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CNN&lt;/span&gt;
    Money&lt;/a&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Topeka, Kansas changes name to Google, Kansas. Google changes name
to&amp;nbsp;Topeka.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Search result timing - A Google search for &amp;#8220;Jason Antman&amp;#8221; was
    completed in &amp;#8220;2.00 shakes of a lamb&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;tail&amp;#8221;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a side note, I&amp;#8217;m quite sad that the Store Anything &lt;a href="https://spreadsheets.google.com/viewform?hl=en&amp;amp;formkey=dEx3d1BSR1Ntb0hvdEpJNkJvaUI2Z2c6MQ"&gt;beta test
form&lt;/a&gt;
(&lt;a href="/GFX/viewform.html"&gt;local copy&lt;/a&gt;)doesn&amp;#8217;t work. When they asked what
object I wanted to store, I checked &amp;#8220;other&amp;#8221; for &amp;#8220;exotic matter&amp;#8221;, and
entered the following description of why I should be allowed to test the&amp;nbsp;service:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily for google, the exotic matter that I intend to store has a
negative mass. Not only is it much simpler for me to let Google&amp;#8217;s
massive engineering team (the same one that figured out how to run
their search engine on SkyLab and the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WOPR&lt;/span&gt;) figure out how to store
such a substance, but it also means that I should be able to receive
storage for free. In fact, my collection of negative mass matter
should be large enough (no pun intended) to offset the entire cost of
Store&amp;nbsp;Antyhing!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, Google has a history of April Fool&amp;#8217;s pranks that goes back to
the earliest days. Much can be found about them
&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google's_hoaxes"&gt;online&lt;/a&gt;. But by far my
favorite was last year, when (in an apparent showing of how easy it is
for them to make changes to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GWS&lt;/span&gt; and roll them out over their entire
infrastructure) they changed the Server &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTTP&lt;/span&gt; header to a number of
random and humorous names, including Microsoft &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IIS&lt;/span&gt;/3.0, Apache/0.8.4,
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;HAL&lt;/span&gt; 9000, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WOPR&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CERN&lt;/span&gt;, and&amp;nbsp;SkyNet.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">admin</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 01 Apr 2010 07:44:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:blog.jasonantman.com,2010-04-01:2010/04/happy-april-fools-day/</guid></item><item><title>Downtime past few days, coping with storms</title><link>http://blog.jasonantman.com/2010/03/downtime-past-few-days-coping-with-storms/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;As far as I can see from &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/"&gt;Google
Analytics&lt;/a&gt;, though I&amp;#8217;m now up to about
4,000 visitors per month for this blog, it seems like most are one-time
visitors. So hopefully the few hiccups of the past few days weren&amp;#8217;t
noticed (except by me, and my mailserver&amp;#8230;). As many of you in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt;
may know, New Jersey was hit by a pretty big nor&amp;#8217;easter last weekend and
my area was
&lt;a href="http://www.northjersey.com/news/bergen/87665172_Weekend_storm_thrashes_Wyckoff.html"&gt;especially&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.northjersey.com/news/87704777_Ridgewood_power_outages_could_last_for_days.html"&gt;hard&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.northjersey.com/news/87852727_Downed_trees__power_lines_bring_Glen_Rock_to_a_near_standstill.html"&gt;hit&lt;/a&gt;.
I lost power for about five hours Saturday night (the 13th) and again
for an hour or so the next morning. Needless to say, these were both
much longer than my small UPSes could cope with (the smaller of the two
has a mere 12 minutes of runtime with brand new batteries). While I do
have a small (2500W) gas generator, it was buried in the back of the
garage. The time it would take to dig it out and string extension cords
from the UPSes to a relatively dry area outside would probably be more
than 12 minutes - not to mention that as first lieutenant
(second-in-command) of the town&amp;#8217;s volunteer &lt;a href="http://www.midlandparkambulance.com/"&gt;ambulance
corps&lt;/a&gt;, I was running in the
opposite direction once things got&amp;nbsp;bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily, the problems caused or uncovered by the power loss were
relatively&amp;nbsp;minor:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The batteries in my smaller &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UPS&lt;/span&gt; lasted about 90 seconds. I&amp;#8217;d noticed
    the bad battery light a few weeks ago, but put it off (hey, it&amp;#8217;s my
    home setup, I don&amp;#8217;t exactly have a budget).
    &lt;a href="http://www.refurbups.com"&gt;RefurbUPS&lt;/a&gt;, where I got the two &lt;span class="caps"&gt;APC&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SU1000NET&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s, got me a replacement &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RBC6&lt;/span&gt; (aftermarket, not original
    &lt;span class="caps"&gt;APC&lt;/span&gt;) in two days, for around $73. Unfortunately, my Tripp Lite
    &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SMART2200RMXL2U&lt;/span&gt; (unfortunately without the external battery pack)
    also just had its orange light pop on, so there goes another&amp;nbsp;$90.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The battery replacement caused another short (\~5 minute) downtime
    tonight, including my router. Unfortunately the router is plugged
    into the smaller of the two UPSes, and none of my current boxes have
    more than one power supply. Mistake. Especially considering my
    limited resources. On the positive side, I took the opportunity to
    move all of the equipment onto &lt;a href="http://www.liebert.com/product_pages/Product.aspx?id=6&amp;amp;hz=60"&gt;Liebert
    MicroPOD&lt;/a&gt;s.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The external &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SATA&lt;/span&gt; disk for my desktop used to store media is dead.
    I&amp;#8217;m getting incessant read errors, followed by offlining the disk,
    on two &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USB&lt;/span&gt; adapters and internal &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SATA&lt;/span&gt;. I guess I should have a
    better surge protector for the&amp;nbsp;desktop.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A few of my boxes didn&amp;#8217;t come up clean, mainly due to entropy in the
    configs, or services that were never &lt;code&gt;chkconfig&lt;/code&gt;&amp;#8216;ed. Well, I don&amp;#8217;t
    use any configuration management at&amp;nbsp;home.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One of the disks in my storage server (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;RAID&lt;/span&gt; 1+0 of 6x 36.4Gb 10k &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RPM&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SCSI&lt;/span&gt; disks) died - actually a few days before the power outage. I
    was able to find a new replacement on Ebay, with warranty, for about&amp;nbsp;$40.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many of my internal services - including a lot of the
    &lt;a href="http://www.nagios.org"&gt;Nagios&lt;/a&gt; checks - use a separate gigabit
    management network, run off of an older GigE aggregation switch.
    This was on the smaller &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UPS&lt;/span&gt;, so it went down quick. As both this and
    my main switch are of the same series, perhaps an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RPS&lt;/span&gt; unit would be
    worth the&amp;nbsp;money.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plans for the&amp;nbsp;future:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get &lt;a href="http://reductivelabs.com/products/puppet/"&gt;Puppet&lt;/a&gt; working at
    home. As part of this, buy a spare server so I can migrate services
    one at a time to a puppet-ized version, test, and then rebuild
    (while the production machine is still&amp;nbsp;running).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the future, given my limited infrastructure, purchasing dual
    power supply machines - and putting the PSes on separate UPSes -
    would be a good&amp;nbsp;thing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Configure the Tripp Lite &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UPS&lt;/span&gt; to do load&amp;nbsp;shedding.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Setup &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UPS&lt;/span&gt; management software to bring down boxes in a logical&amp;nbsp;order.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Power savings is also important - so I&amp;#8217;m thinking about rebuilding
    things using &lt;a href="http://www.xen.org/"&gt;Xen&lt;/a&gt;, and using live migration to
    both distribute load logically under normal circumstances, and to
    move around loads in the event of power failure (kill
    non-critical/internal-only stuff, consolidate the&amp;nbsp;rest).&lt;/li&gt;

days here in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NJ&lt;/span&gt;, Cablevision and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ABC&lt;/span&gt; are involved in a feud. Cablevision
is advertising everywhere - I heard at least 4 ads on the drive home
from work about how &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ABC&lt;/span&gt; is making unreasonable demands, asking for $40M,&amp;nbsp;etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, then I found something more interesting. I stopped at a friend&amp;#8217;s
after work and turned on the (Cablevision) cable box. Strange. It was a
full-screen ad from Cablevision about the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ABC&lt;/span&gt; situation. And it seemed
to go on forever. But&amp;#8230; huh? The cable box was tuned to channel&amp;#8230;
1999. I changed the channel, and got regular &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TV&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when I got home and turned on &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; cable box - which was last tuned
to channel 47 and is setup to resume on the last channel it was tuned to
- it also started up to the Cablevision ad on channel&amp;nbsp;1999.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To anyone who&amp;#8217;s read Jonathan Zittrain&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Future-Internet-How-Stop/dp/0300151241/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1267669057&amp;amp;sr=8-1"&gt;The Future of the Internet and
How to Stop
It&lt;/a&gt;,
this is as clear an indication of the problems with appliancization as&amp;nbsp;anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#8217;t take this lightly. It has some serious implications. Specifically,
the basics of what Cablevision&amp;nbsp;did:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pushed out a new software version to all of their cable boxes, very
    quickly, that added a new&amp;nbsp;channel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Changed an arbitrary setting in the configuration of their
    customer&amp;#8217;s boxes (the channel that displays at power on)&amp;nbsp;remotely.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea that Cablevision can control all of their customer&amp;#8217;s boxes
remotely, and this quickly, is a bit disturbing. If any of you have ever
checked out the diagnostic mode on a Scientific Atlanta box, you&amp;#8217;d know
that it&amp;#8217;s more or less a full computer (the &amp;#8220;channels&amp;#8221; are actually
streaming media over &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IP&lt;/span&gt;) and the amount of control that Cablevision has
is virtually&amp;nbsp;limitless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(The automatic channel change has been confirmed by a number

The title of this post includes the word &amp;#8220;hacker&amp;#8221;. If you think that has
anything to do with illegal acts or unethical behavior, you&amp;#8217;ve fallen
victim to what happens when the mainstream media latches on to a term
they don&amp;#8217;t understand. The
&lt;a href="http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/H/hacker.html"&gt;definition&lt;/a&gt; of
this word is far from negative. Within the geek community, the title
&amp;#8220;hacker&amp;#8221; is the utmost compliment - something like Grand Master in the
martial arts, or perhaps whatever title is given to an eminent artist.
It both describes someone who is an expert in their field. Or, more
generally, someone who enjoys seeking knowledge simply for the sake of
knowledge - figuring out how things work, how to make them, and how to
make them better. If you&amp;#8217;re looking for a term that describes a
criminal, &amp;#8220;attacker&amp;#8221;, &amp;#8220;malicious user&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;computer criminal&amp;#8221; work fine.
While I wouldn&amp;#8217;t by any extent consider myself a hacker in the
super-genius-wizard sense of the term, I do definitely subscribe to the
hacker ethic - the burning need to figure out how things work and make
them&amp;nbsp;better.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the snow at the end of last week, and a long weekend, I
actually got to do some reading that didn&amp;#8217;t involve man pages or books
strictly about software. I finally finished &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Daemon-Gnu-Penguin-Peter-Salus/dp/097903423X"&gt;The Daemon, the Gnu, and
the
Penguin&lt;/a&gt;
by Peter H. Salus, a wonderful book (with a great foreword by maddog
Hall). I also &lt;em&gt;finally&lt;/em&gt; got a chance to start reading &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Cathedral-Bazaar-Musings-Accidental-Revolutionary/dp/0596001088/"&gt;The Cathedral &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;
the Bazaar: Musings on Linux and Open Source by an Accidental
Revolutionary&lt;/a&gt;
by Eric S. Raymond (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ESR&lt;/span&gt;). I&amp;#8217;m only up to page 50 or so, but it&amp;#8217;s an
equally good book, and I&amp;#8217;ve been looking forward to reading it for&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve always been very interested in history (heck, I have a minor in
it), and specifically the history of my other interests. When
photography took up most of my time, I read every photo history book I
could get my hands on (including many primary sources on now-archaic
techniques). In the past few years, I&amp;#8217;ve been amassing books on
computing history (specifically &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ARPANET&lt;/span&gt;/the Internet and Unix/Linux/Free
software) at a near-alarming&amp;nbsp;rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through all of my reading, two main things have struck me: the utterly
amazing feats accomplished by previous generations, and how my own
generation takes them for granted. I was born in 1987 which, I feel,
makes me part of a very small group who were lucky enough to grow up
during the real rise of the Internet. I remember playing simple games on
my grandmother&amp;#8217;s (business) &lt;span class="caps"&gt;386DX&lt;/span&gt; long before I could read most of the
words on the screen. But I also remember my father dialing in to an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISP&lt;/span&gt;
(I honestly don&amp;#8217;t remember which one) on a 9600 baud serial modem, and
how unique that was at the time (at least among kids my age). By 13 or
so, I had a 10BaseT network in my house, sharing a 56k dial-up
connection between two computers. I feel that I&amp;#8217;m part of a short
historical period of kids who &amp;#8220;grew up&amp;#8221; with computers, used them in
middle school, are perfectly at home with them, but still remember
dial-up, the launch of Windows 98, and ordering Linux on CDs because you
just couldn&amp;#8217;t get it any other way (too young to have access to the
resources of a college, only&amp;nbsp;dial-up).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, on to my&amp;nbsp;point&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I read about those who stepped before me (and my generation), those
who thought up such amazing ideas as Unix, the Internet, networking and
most of the software and protocols we have today, I realize how big
their shoes are, and how difficult it will be for the next generation to
fill them. Sure, we have Facebook, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RSS&lt;/span&gt; feeds, Web 2.0 and smartphones,
but will we be able to innovate on the level that those who came before
us did? And then it strikes me how much we young aspiring hackers take
for granted. How many aspects of technology today would be seemed
impossible 20 years ago, but we use without a second&amp;nbsp;thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last generation of hackers and programmers were raised on software
distribution tapes. Their idea of &amp;#8220;open&amp;#8221; was formed by what they were
used to - a Cathedral development model, with regular releases
(production, perhaps beta, perhaps even less) and accompanying source
code. However, in the pre-Internet days, they were still bound by
physical media. They were still bound to the Cathedral development
model, to a small and tight-knit group of sages determining when the
world was ready to see the fruits of their&amp;nbsp;labor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current generation - those of us just out of college or grad school,
or even younger - think of Linux as the quintessential open source
project. For those of us who came into computing when Linux was already
around (I first ran Linux in 2001 when, at 14, I bought the
newly-released &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CD&lt;/span&gt; set of SuSE 7.3), Linux sets the bar. It&amp;#8217;s what we
were raised on (at least in terms of open source). Fixed releases - even
with source - seem antiquated, pre-Internet, our fathers&amp;#8217; open source.
To us, open means nightly builds, world-readable ticket/bug trackers,
anonymous Git or &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SVN&lt;/span&gt; access, and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RSS&lt;/span&gt; feeds of every commit. It means
being able to see every line of code at every moment in time, even if
we&amp;#8217;ve never e-mailed one of the&amp;nbsp;developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even just a few years ago, the word &amp;#8220;open&amp;#8221; was used by vendors to mean
almost anything - everything from software based on Linux, to software
that included source (regardless of the license) to software that just
used (patent encumbered) documented protocols or formats. For the next
generation, even the generation entering the workforce now, open means
much more. It means transparency in development, in code, in
documentation, in&amp;nbsp;management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many times, I&amp;#8217;ve found an &amp;#8220;open&amp;#8221; software project, and searched their
web site endlessly looking for links to Git or &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SVN&lt;/span&gt; or &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CVS&lt;/span&gt;. Or looked
endlessly for the (internal) bug tracker. Every time, I had to remind
myself that the world, even many of the open source projects, are still
far behind my expectations. Even Google&amp;#8217;s Android Open Source project
only has code merged in periodically from the production (closed) tree,
and maintains a separate bug tracker. Far from my expectation of just
having some parts of the tree unavailable on the Internet, and some
classes of bugs filtered out from public&amp;nbsp;view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nobody - not even Microsoft - can deny that the world is moving more and
more to open source. It&amp;#8217;s already the de-facto standard on the Internet,
but it&amp;#8217;s moving more and more to the desktop every day. And, as this
happens, the expectations of what open means (increasingly more
transparent than just &amp;#8220;open&amp;#8221;) are also increasing. The software world -
both proprietary and open source - will have to keep up. And, hopefully,
as the generation raised on the Internet begins to fill the ranks of
geeks in the workforce, we&amp;#8217;ll see more and more open source&amp;nbsp;usage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a side note, I&amp;#8217;d be very interested to see how open source use
compares to demographics. I know that Linux use (on student-owned
computers) at most colleges is way above the global average, and the
same goes for&amp;nbsp;Firefox.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">admin</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 02 Mar 2010 21:45:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>tag:blog.jasonantman.com,2010-03-02:2010/03/the-newest-generation-of-hackers/</guid><category>free</category><category>hacker</category><category>linux</category><category>open source</category><category>svn</category></item><item><title>Links for Tuesday, March 2, 2010</title><link>http://blog.jasonantman.com/2010/03/links-for-tuesday-march-2-2010/</link><description>&lt;ul&gt;

post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The past 48 hours has been very eventful in my Android world. Thanks to
the instructions on &lt;a href="http://rootyourdroid.info"&gt;rootyourdroid.info&lt;/a&gt;
(hey, it&amp;#8217;s an expensive phone and locked hardware - I&amp;#8217;m not fooling
around the way I would with something &lt;a href="/2009/11/root-on-a-cyclades-acs-console-server/"&gt;more
common&lt;/a&gt;),
I rooted my droid and did a few minor hacks. Though, I must say, it
pains me to see all of the post-rooting instructions based on access via
adb, instead of using a terminal emulator on the phone. Also, last
night, my mother (definitely &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a technical person) for a Droid - and
loves it! (My dad got one a month or two&amp;nbsp;ago).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, in the last 24 hours, I&amp;#8217;ve gone app-crazy. I thought I&amp;#8217;d share
some of my findings here. Unfortunately, while a few of the app/file
managers out there do dump a list of applications, I can&amp;#8217;t find one that
dumps a list including the package names (which are required to create
an effective link to the app). If any of you know of one, please
enlighten me. For now, I&amp;#8217;ll construct this list by hand (using the list
from &lt;a href="market://details?id=com.metago.astro"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ASTRO&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; 2.2.4), and maybe
write an app to do it in the&amp;nbsp;future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Note: These links all use the market:// &lt;span class="caps"&gt;URI&lt;/span&gt; scheme, so they&amp;#8217;re only
useful if clicked on an Android device with the Market&amp;nbsp;app.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="market://details?id=lysesoft.andftp"&gt;AndFTP&lt;/a&gt; (1.3) - A good
    &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FTP&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SFTP&lt;/span&gt; client for Android, includes pubkey-based authentication
    and host&amp;nbsp;storage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="market://details?id=net.sf.andbatdog.batterydog"&gt;Android Battery
    Dog&lt;/a&gt; (0.1.2) - An
    app that runs as a service and collects &lt;em&gt;detailed&lt;/em&gt; statistics on
    battery usage, including temperature, charge percent, voltage,
    discharge rate, battery technology and external power status. While
    it can display a graph or formatted data, its&amp;#8217; real shining point is
    the ability to export timestamped semicolon-delimited data files for
    external graphing and&amp;nbsp;analysis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="market://details?id=com.appdroid.anycut"&gt;Any Cut&lt;/a&gt; (1.0) - Allows
    you to create shortcuts on your home screen to almost anything,
    including Android &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OS&lt;/span&gt; Acitvities, direct calls or direct text&amp;nbsp;messages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="market://details?id=com.metago.astro"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ASTRO&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (2.2.4) - File manager
    that allows copying of files on the device (both internal memory and
    &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SD&lt;/span&gt; card), image and file viewing, listing/management of apps
    (including finding out the package name of an App), reading of tar
    and tgz files,&amp;nbsp;etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="market://details?id=com.geekyouup.android.widgets.battery"&gt;Battery
    Widget&lt;/a&gt;
    (1.5.2, by mippin) - Very simple widget for the home screen that
    takes up one square and shows current battery level. When clicked,
    provides shortcuts to settings screens for display, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPS&lt;/span&gt;, WiFi and&amp;nbsp;Bluetooth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="market://details?id=com.apksoftware.compass"&gt;Compass&lt;/a&gt; (1.1) -
    Simple compass app. Shows a compass which seems to be accurate,
    current lat/long and current street address. Has extensive settings
    and some nice skins for the&amp;nbsp;compass.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="market://details?id=org.connectbot"&gt;ConnectBot&lt;/a&gt; (1.6.2) - A very
    good &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SSH&lt;/span&gt; client for Android. Allows storage of multiple hosts,
    pubkey-based authentication (with a master password), etc.
    Unfortunately, doesn&amp;#8217;t seem to have any way (that I can find) to
    enter certain characters, such as tab and pipe&amp;nbsp;(|).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="market://details?id=com.mgeek.android.DolphinBrowser.Browser"&gt;Dolphin
    Browser&lt;/a&gt;
    (2.5.0) - An alternate browser for Android. I haven&amp;#8217;t used it
    extensively yet, but it shows multiple tabs at the top of the screen
    like Firefox (easier to switch between tabs than the stock browser&amp;#8217;s
    Menu -&gt; Windows) and &lt;strong&gt;supports iPhone-like multitouch on the
    Droid&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="market://details?id=com.gmail.nagamatu.drocap2"&gt;drocap2&lt;/a&gt; (2.07) -
    Screen capture program (requires root). Allows you to trigger a
    capture from the notifications bar and stores captures on the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SD&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;card.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="market://details?id=com.motorola.dlight"&gt;DroidLight&lt;/a&gt; (3.0) - Nice
    twist on the usual flashlight app. By Motorola, this app triggers
    the camera&amp;#8217;s flash &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LED&lt;/span&gt; in a steady burn mode, providing very good
    light output. Probably a real battery&amp;nbsp;killer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="market://details?id=com.levelup.foxyring"&gt;FoxyRing&lt;/a&gt; (1.12) - This
    was an ANdroid Developer Challenge winner and, among other things,
    it claims to monitor ambient sound levels and adjust your ringer
    volume to match them. Unfortunately, due to the overly restrictive
    End User License Agreement (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;EULA&lt;/span&gt;), specifically the strong
    provisions against reverse engineering and redistribution, I was
    forced to uninstall the app before even trying&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="market://details?id=com.eclipsim.gpsstatus2"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPS&lt;/span&gt; Status&lt;/a&gt; (3.0.3) -
    Very nice app. Provides a display like a real &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPS&lt;/span&gt;, showing the
    location and status of various satellites (in a rotating compass),
    heading and orientation, number of fixes, estimated error (DoP),
    signal strength graph for stelites, speed, altitude, pitch/tilt of
    phone, magnetic field, acceleration, coordinates and time of last&amp;nbsp;fix.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="market://details?id=com.magicandroidapps.iperf"&gt;iPerf&lt;/a&gt; (1.07) - An
    iPerf client for Android that seems to work fine. How cool! Seems to
    be a wrapper around the binary, lets you specify &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CLI&lt;/span&gt; arguments,
    shows console&amp;nbsp;output.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="market://details?id=com.meebo"&gt;Meebo &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (22) - A simple, good,
    multi-protocol &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IM&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;application.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="market://details?id=com.imkurt.metaldetector"&gt;Metal Detector&lt;/a&gt;
    (1.2-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;RELEASE&lt;/span&gt;) - Maybe not that useful, but way cool. The Droid (and
    perhaps other phones?) uses the compass to detect magnetic fields to
    trigger the modes for car dock and multimedia dock. This turns it
    into a metal detector. Wonderful cool-ness&amp;nbsp;factor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="market://details?id=de.schoar.nagroid"&gt;Nagroid&lt;/a&gt; (0.0.7) - A Nagios
    watcher for Android. Can be configured with only one &lt;span class="caps"&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt;, but can do
    &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTTP&lt;/span&gt; Basic Auth and handle self-signed &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SSL&lt;/span&gt; certs. Options to hide
    everything that&amp;#8217;s &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt;, and show only unhandled (un-acknowledged)
    problems. Also can start a service to poll and alert at regular
    intervals. Only down side is that it only handles one Nagios&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="market://details?id=info.lamatricexiste.network"&gt;Network Discovery&lt;/a&gt;
    (0.2.7.1) - Intersting little app that I haven&amp;#8217;t played around with
    much. Does port scans of IPs and runs a &amp;#8220;network discovery&amp;#8221; of the
    &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LAN&lt;/span&gt;, though it doesn&amp;#8217;t say whether it is active (ping/port scanning)
    or passive (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ARP&lt;/span&gt;). Displays info on devices (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;IP&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MAC&lt;/span&gt; address, decodes
    &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MAC&lt;/span&gt; manufacturer name from address) and a button to run a port&amp;nbsp;scan.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="market://details?id=com.eolwral.osmonitor"&gt;OSMonitor&lt;/a&gt; (1.1.0) -
    Good process monitor for Android - shows running processes. load
    from each process, total &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CPU&lt;/span&gt; usage, network information for all NICs
    (WiFi, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BT&lt;/span&gt;, cellular/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PPP&lt;/span&gt;), active &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TCP&lt;/span&gt; connections, battery status,
    storage status (of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ALL&lt;/span&gt; filesystems), and internal&amp;nbsp;log.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="market://details?id=com.mm.network"&gt;Ping&lt;/a&gt; (1.5.3) - Simple ping
    app. Lets you enter an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IP&lt;/span&gt; and select how many pings to send out.
    Shows console&amp;nbsp;output.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="market://details?id=com.shazam.android"&gt;Shazam&lt;/a&gt; (1.3) - Yup, same
    thing that was the killer app for&amp;nbsp;iPhone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="market://details?id=com.riteshsahu.SMSBackupRestore"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SMS&lt;/span&gt; Backup &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;
    Restore&lt;/a&gt; (2.1)&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allows backup and restore of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SMS&lt;/span&gt; data to/from &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SD&lt;/span&gt; card, as an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;XML&lt;/span&gt;
file. Good for Droid users who experience the &lt;a href="http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=5669"&gt;disappearing
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SMS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;bug.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="market://details?id=org.zwanoo.android.speedtest"&gt;Speed Test&lt;/a&gt;
    (1.7.0) - A simple speed test app for Android from speedtest.net.
    Not sure how accurate it is, but it does upload and download tests
    over WiFi or&amp;nbsp;cellular/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PPP&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="market://details?id=com.wasserwaage"&gt;Spirit Level Plus&lt;/a&gt; (1.2) -
    Simple but cool. Spirit level for the phone, using the builtin
    accelerometer. Seems relatively&amp;nbsp;accurate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="market://details?id=com.sportstracklive.stopwatch"&gt;StopWatch&lt;/a&gt;
    (1.07) - &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWFUL&lt;/span&gt;. It&amp;#8217;s a stopwatch app, but I could &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; get it to
    stop displaying stuff in the notifications&amp;nbsp;bar.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="market://details?id=jackpal.androidterm"&gt;Terminal Emulator&lt;/a&gt; (1.0.4)&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Terminal emulator for Android. It feels so wonderful to be able to
pull up an app, pop open the keyboard, and type &amp;#8220;su&amp;#8221; on my phone. On
the down side, once again, I can&amp;#8217;t figure out how to enter the pipe
or tab characters, and I don&amp;#8217;t know what shell the phone has on&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="market://details?id=com.farproc.wifi.analyzer"&gt;Wifi Analyzer&lt;/a&gt;
    (2.2.9) - &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;REALLY&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;COOL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Vaguely
    &lt;a href="http://www.metageek.net/products/wi-spy-24x"&gt;WiSpy&lt;/a&gt; like, but I
    doubt it&amp;#8217;s accurate. Shows a graph of spectrum utilization with
    SSIDs and signal strength, a time-based graph of signal strength per
    &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SSID&lt;/span&gt;, a simple list of APs with channel number, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BSSID&lt;/span&gt;, frequency,
    signal strength and encryption, and a simple &amp;#8220;signal meter&amp;#8221;. Looks
    like it could be pretty&amp;nbsp;useful.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="market://details?id=gr.androiddev.WifiScanner"&gt;WifiScanner&lt;/a&gt; (1.7) -
    Simple WiFi scanner app. Shows all detected WiFi APs along with
    &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SSID&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BSSID&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;MAC&lt;/span&gt;, signal level, channel and&amp;nbsp;encryption.&lt;/li&gt;

    I must say, the author of this blog is really looking at things from
    a modern-day perspective, and his commentary seems to miss how truly
    brilliant these ideas were at the&amp;nbsp;time)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

Stumbles&lt;/a&gt;. Apparently,
according to Net Applications, Linux&amp;#8217;s market share rose from 1 to 1.02
percent in December 2009, a small but hopeful increase. Windows
marketshare fell from 92.52% to&amp;nbsp;92.21%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like any statistic, there are always multiple sources. The
&lt;a href="www.w3counter.com"&gt;W3Counter.com&lt;/a&gt; reports are a bit brighter for&amp;nbsp;Linux:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this is accurate, it shows Linux with a sifnigicant 1-month gain in
marketshare. Also notable is that in December, Android showed up for the
first time, at 0.08%. In all reasonabless, that can be added to the
Linux&amp;nbsp;row.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also of interest are W3Counter&amp;#8217;s browser&amp;nbsp;stats:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
+0.04%

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also worth noting on the Browser front is that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IE8&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s market share rose
from 21.21% (November) to 22.43% (December) while Firefox 3.5&amp;#8217;s share
jumped from 20.49% in November to 22.18% in December, a very significant
stride for the brand new Firefox version. While &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IE8&lt;/span&gt; has been out
considerably longer than Firefox 3.5, they&amp;#8217;re already almost tied in

&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_medical_technician"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;EMT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and at
times an outdoorsy-type person, I occasionally get emails from friends
about disaster-related topics. Especially in the post-9/11 days.
Recently, I got an email asking me if I&amp;#8217;d seen the Department of
Homeland Security&amp;#8217;s disaster preparedness site,
&lt;a href="http://www.ready.gov"&gt;ready.gov&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;#8217;d heard a bit about it, but hadn&amp;#8217;t
really looked around. The site&amp;#8217;s main premise is to educate people about
how to prepare for a disaster - &amp;#8220;get a kit&amp;#8221;, &amp;#8220;make a plan&amp;#8221;, &amp;#8220;be&amp;nbsp;informed&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The site&amp;#8217;s own &lt;a href="http://www.ready.gov/america/about/index.html"&gt;About
page&lt;/a&gt; states that it is
&amp;#8220;designed to educate and empower Americans to prepare for and respond to
emergencies including natural and man-made disasters. The goal of the
campaign is to get the public involved and ultimately to increase the
level of basic preparedness across the&amp;nbsp;nation.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first step on the site, &lt;a href="http://www.ready.gov/america/getakit/index.html"&gt;&amp;#8220;Get a
Kit&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt;, includes a list
of supplies to have on hand as a basic disaster kit. The introduction to
the page&amp;nbsp;reads:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may need to survive on your own after an emergency. This means
having your own food, water, and other supplies in sufficient quantity
to last for at least three days. Local officials and relief workers
will be on the scene after a disaster, but they cannot reach everyone
immediately. You could get help in hours, or it might take days. In
addition, basic services such as electricity, gas, water, sewage
treatment, and telephones may be cut off for days, or even a week or&amp;nbsp;longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will admit, I assumed this would be geared more towards urbanites, not
those of us in the suburbs or rural America (the latter generally being
more accustomed to self-sufficiency), so I adjusted my expectations
accordingly. At first glance, it seems to include most of the things
that the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EMT&lt;/span&gt; in me would want it&amp;nbsp;to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Food and&amp;nbsp;water&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First aid&amp;nbsp;kit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wrench or pliers to turn off gas&amp;nbsp;line&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prescription&amp;nbsp;medications&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bleach (as a disinfectant and for water&amp;nbsp;purification)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fire&amp;nbsp;extinguisher&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Matches&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I found a number of things obviously missing. Sure, some are
minor - matches but no mention of fuel, bleach but not even coffee
filters to remove particulate matter from water. I also find it comical
that so many years after the Cold War &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_and_cover"&gt;&amp;#8220;Duck and
Cover&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt; approach to nuclear
safety, the government is now telling people to
&lt;a href="http://www.ready.gov/america/makeaplan/shelter_in_place.html"&gt;Shelter-In-Place&lt;/a&gt;
in the event of a biological attack - by covering their doors and
windows with plastic&amp;nbsp;sheeting!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But by far the most egregious omission from the list - something learned
by man at least 5,000 years ago, and taught to every Boy Scout - is the
simplest tool: a knife. Yup, that&amp;#8217;s right, the Disaster Kit list doesn&amp;#8217;t
include &lt;strong&gt;any variety of cutting implement&lt;/strong&gt;. I don&amp;#8217;t know if whoever
wrote up the list is just scared of getting sued when little Bobby finds
the knife and kills himself, or whether they&amp;#8217;re really that stupid. But
I, for one, never leave my house without some variety of the oldest real
tool devised by man, and can&amp;#8217;t imagine anyone thrown into any sort of
&amp;#8220;survival&amp;#8221; situation without at least a rudimentary way to cut, scrape,
pry, etc. I&amp;#8217;d say that if I were without utilities or organized public
safety for &amp;#8220;at least three days&amp;#8221;, I&amp;#8217;d sure want to be able to make
simple repairs, fashion simple tools, or perhaps cut&amp;nbsp;something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On another (albeit less important) note, there are still &lt;em&gt;many, many&lt;/em&gt;
Americans, not just in rural areas, who have a fireplace or wood stove.
What about a few days&amp;#8217; worth of&amp;nbsp;wood?&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">admin</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 20 Jan 2010 21:25:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>tag:blog.jasonantman.com,2010-01-20:2010/01/federal-government-ignoring-what-we-learned-5000-years-ago/</guid><category>disaster</category><category>EMS</category><category>government</category><category>preparedness</category></item><item><title>Android 2.0.1 update</title><link>http://blog.jasonantman.com/2009/12/android-2-0-1-update/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;So, I updated my Droid to Android 2.0.1 today. I&amp;#8217;ll be honest that it
didn&amp;#8217;t work the way I&amp;#8217;d hoped. When I woke up this morning (December
10&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; 2009) I had an alert dialog on screen telling me that an update
was ready. It gave me three options: &amp;#8220;Install Now&amp;#8221;, &amp;#8220;Install Later&amp;#8221; and
&amp;#8220;More Info&amp;#8221;. The More Info screen didn&amp;#8217;t show me anything useful. Well,
I clicked the &amp;#8220;Later&amp;#8221; option, figuring that when I got home tonight I&amp;#8217;d
turn on WiFi, do a packet capture on the router, and save all of the
traffic (specifically including the name of the update server). Well, it
kept reminding me all day at annoyingly short intervals - probably about
every 10 minutes or so. Finally, when I was home and had the WiFi setup,
I went to try it again and&amp;#8230; yup&amp;#8230; when I clicked on the &amp;#8220;System
Update&amp;#8221; button in Settings, the only option I had was &amp;#8220;Reboot and&amp;nbsp;Install&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So&amp;#8230; first big bitch about the Droid&amp;#8230; Verizon pushed out the update
without my consent. I kept hitting &amp;#8220;Later&amp;#8221; because that was the only way
to get the popup to go away. Apparently. after X times of hitting Later
(and each time your only real options are Later or Now) it will download
the update by itself. Once the update is downloaded, I&amp;#8217;m assuming that
it &lt;em&gt;may&lt;/em&gt; just automatically install on the next reboot. That would be
a bitch thing to&amp;nbsp;do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the &amp;#8220;More Info&amp;#8221; screen, which provides (as far as I can tell)
the only release notes for the update,&amp;nbsp;states:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This software update includes enhancements to your &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DROID&lt;/span&gt; by Motorola.
Approximate install time: 6-10 Mins. You will be unable to use your
device or make emergency calls for the duration of the install. The
software updates automatically, and your &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DROID&lt;/span&gt; will power off and on
as part of this software update. For more information please visit:
&lt;a href="www.verizonwireless.com/droidsupport"&gt;www.verizonwireless.com/droidsupport&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not too helpful. And pretty&amp;nbsp;cryptic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Immediately when the phone turned back on, the first thing I noticed is
that the spin-style unlock button has been replaced with an iPhone-style
slide button, and the same for the mute feature. Maybe it&amp;#8217;s just me, but
I also noticed that the on screen keyboard seems to react better to
quick keypresses - perhaps they&amp;#8217;ve enabled multitouch for&amp;nbsp;this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I wasn&amp;#8217;t able to find much release documentation from
Google other than the &lt;a href="http://developer.android.com/sdk/android-2.0.1.html"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt;
changes&lt;/a&gt; - no full
release notes or changelog like I&amp;#8217;d like. And not even a summary of
changes that I could&amp;nbsp;find.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VZW&lt;/span&gt; droid support site, I found a &lt;a href="http://learning.verizonwireless.com/learning/Droid_Motorola_Software_Update.pdf"&gt;link to a
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PDF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
of &amp;#8220;Why to Update&amp;#8221; (&lt;a href="/GFX/Droid_Motorola_Software_Update.pdf"&gt;local
copy&lt;/a&gt;).
This sheet lists the enhancements made by the update
(&amp;#8220;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AP&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ESD56&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;BP&lt;/span&gt;:C_01.3E.01P&amp;#8221;, build &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ESD56&lt;/span&gt;)&amp;nbsp;as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;OS&lt;/span&gt; stability is&amp;nbsp;improved.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Battery life is&amp;nbsp;improved.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Camera auto focus functionality is improved, and time between shots
    is&amp;nbsp;reduced.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enhancements for three-way&amp;nbsp;calling.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Audio for incoming calls is&amp;nbsp;improved.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When receiving a call on call waiting, the speakerphone now remains&amp;nbsp;on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bluetooth functionality is improved; background echo is&amp;nbsp;eliminated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improved Bluetooth phone book transfer of contacts to in-vehicle
    Bluetooth&amp;nbsp;solutions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After closing a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPS&lt;/span&gt; application, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPS&lt;/span&gt; icon will now automatically
    be removed from the notification&amp;nbsp;panel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Users can now receive &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SMS&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MMS&lt;/span&gt; messages after an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EMS&lt;/span&gt; message is&amp;nbsp;received.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SMS&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MMS&lt;/span&gt; may now be sent to seven-digit&amp;nbsp;addresses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google contact merging has been updated to accommodate seven-digit&amp;nbsp;numbers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Visual Voice Mail notices now arrive&amp;nbsp;instantaneously.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The corporate calendar widget user interface is&amp;nbsp;updated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tiny one-page (and very styish - looks like and in-store
advertising piece) sheet obviously isn&amp;#8217;t anything that could pass for
release notes, especially from Google. It doesn&amp;#8217;t even mention anything
about the changed unlock&amp;nbsp;button!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ll keep looking around to find a real feature summary/release
notes/changelog, but here&amp;#8217;s my running list (I&amp;#8217;ll update) of what I&amp;#8217;ve&amp;nbsp;found:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Changed the unlock slider to a straight&amp;nbsp;line.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On screen keyboard typing seems&amp;nbsp;faster.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Photo taking &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; considerably faster, though it&amp;#8217;s still painfully
    slow - it used to take about 10 seconds from shutter button to ready
    to capture next image, it&amp;#8217;s now about 5&amp;nbsp;seconds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UI&lt;/span&gt; seems to be a bit more responsive&amp;nbsp;overall.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I haven&amp;#8217;t checked yet, but I&amp;#8217;ve seen some forum posts about lost
    contacts and Facebook sync&amp;nbsp;issues.&lt;/li&gt;

with $75 left on it. What a wonderful discovery! One of the pile of
books that I ordered was &lt;a href="http://futureoftheinternet.org/"&gt;The Future of the Internet&amp;#8212;And How to Stop
It&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://futureoftheinternet.org/blog"&gt;by Jonathan
Zittrain&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;#8217;d fully intended to
read the book cover-to-cover, perhaps even digest the content a little,
before throwing my thoughts out there (presumably to get lost into the
vast sea of crap that makes up the &amp;#8220;blogosphere&amp;#8221;). But I just have to
get some thoughts down on&amp;nbsp;paper&amp;#8230;err&amp;#8230;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;LCD&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First off, when I found out that Zittrain is a professor of Internet Law
at Harvard, it immediately told me two things. First, that he probably
sides with content producers and/or Big &amp;#8216;Net a bit too much. Second,
that he probably doesn&amp;#8217;t really understand what the hell he&amp;#8217;s talking
about, or why people made the choices they have. The fact that the first
chapter of the book, which talks about history, doesn&amp;#8217;t seem to mention
ARPAnet once only confirms this. But, the B&amp;amp;N summary sounded like the
book has a healthy dash of iPhone bashing, so I figured it&amp;#8217;s be a good
read. It was also written in 2008, so I figured that the ideas would be
&lt;em&gt;relatively current&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I&amp;#8217;m just under a quarter of the way into the book, and given the
vast mass of notes I&amp;#8217;ve penned in the margins, I think Mr/ Zittrain and
I wouldn&amp;#8217;t get along too well on a desert island. But I&amp;#8217;ll try to
contain my commentary - and attacks upon the author - until I&amp;#8217;m done
with the book. The thought currently in my mind is a very specific&amp;nbsp;one:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many technologically savvy people think that bad code is simply a
Microsoft Windows issue. They believe that the Windows &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OS&lt;/span&gt; and the
Internet Explorer browser are particularly poorly designed, and that
&amp;#8220;better&amp;#8221; counterparts (Linux and MacOS, or the Firefox and Opera
browsers) can help protect a user. This is not much added protection.
Not only do these alternative OSes and browsers have their own
vulnerabilities, but the fundamental problem is that the point of a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PC&lt;/span&gt;
- regardless of its &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OS&lt;/span&gt; - is that its users can easily reconfigure it
to run new software from&amp;nbsp;anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be sure, Microsoft Windows has been the target of malware
infections for years, but this in part reflects Microsoft&amp;#8217;s dominant
market&amp;nbsp;share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, wow, is it 2004 again? I thought we&amp;#8217;d given up on the &amp;#8220;market share&amp;#8221;
argument. When Apache had 10% of the market share of web servers, people
said it wasn&amp;#8217;t attacked as often because of low market share. Well,
Apache
&lt;a href="http://news.netcraft.com/archives/2009/11/10/november_2009_web_server_survey.html"&gt;currently&lt;/a&gt;
has a 47% share of the market, compared to Microsoft&amp;#8217;s 21%, and it&amp;#8217;s
still more secure, more stable, and has fewer critical
vulnerabilities*. The same market share argument was made about Firefox
when it had 5% market share. Now, the share is projected between
&lt;a href="http://www.w3counter.com/globalstats.php"&gt;31.85%&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href="http://www.w3schools.com/browsers/browsers_stats.asp"&gt;47%&lt;/a&gt;, and it
still has less serious vulnerabilities (ones that can actually damage
your computer) than Windows). I thought this &amp;#8220;market share&amp;#8221; argument was
done&amp;nbsp;with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most important is the thing that most Microsoft-biased pundits (and, of
course, Microsoft themselves) don&amp;#8217;t ever talk about: an amazingly large
number of servers run Linux. Especially e-commerce servers which house
loads of personal information and credit card numbers. Estimates for big
e-commerce sites put non-Windows OSes at 30-50%, and they&amp;#8217;re quite
popular among small sites that probably don&amp;#8217;t have well-trained
SysAdmins. So, if Windows wasn&amp;#8217;t really less secure, wouldn&amp;#8217;t we see
e-commerce servers getting compromised left and&amp;nbsp;right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there&amp;#8217;s a more important point here. It&amp;#8217;s about curtailing the
stupidity of users. I know, in Microsoft&amp;#8217;s defense, that Windows Vista
and Windows 7 are supposed to be better with this. But, at least in the
past, Windows had virtually no privilege separation. With a little code,
you could effect the whole system from an arbitrary binary - or worse,
with ActiveX, through the browser. I was dumbfounded that any user could
install a system-wide application. The real issue here, at least with
older Windows (I don&amp;#8217;t know much about the new ones) is that Windows,
from the beginning, wasn&amp;#8217;t written to be secure. Heck, it wasn&amp;#8217;t even
designed to be attached to a real&amp;nbsp;network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Linux does have real security advantages over Windows, and not just
because it has low market share. First is an actual, true implementation
of privilege separation. No matter what I do in my desktop web browser,
no matter what I run, even if I installed a Firefox plugin that wanted
to destroy my machine, it couldn&amp;#8217;t happen. No matter what I let some
random code do, it simply can&amp;#8217;t escape the confines of my user&amp;nbsp;account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, ok, I know what you&amp;#8217;re all saying right now. I can hear it from
here: &amp;#8220;but what if the moron does everything as root? what if they just
sudo anything that they&amp;#8217;re asked about?&amp;#8221; Well, I have answers to that,
too. My own distro of choice, &lt;a href="http://www.opensuse.org"&gt;OpenSuSE&lt;/a&gt;
greatly upset me when I went to install 11.1, and the installer showed a
default of one user account, automatic login, and the same password for
the user and root. That&amp;#8217;s just stupid. In fact, it&amp;#8217;s braindead, plain
and simple. I don&amp;#8217;t care how wonderful it would be to get Linux on every
desktop in the world, if we have to destroy every advantage that Linux
has over other OSes, it will be&amp;nbsp;worthless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I digress. In the end, it boils down to user education. And, in some
respects, I think that Linux has become too dumbed-down. There are
certain things that simply shouldn&amp;#8217;t be put in a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GUI&lt;/span&gt;. Excuse my elitism,
but if you can&amp;#8217;t figure out how to configure Apache correctly from the
command line, you have no business running an Apache installation. The
same goes for countless other services and applications. So, what&amp;#8217;s my
solution? Well, here&amp;#8217;s what I do when I install Linux for non-technical
friends. Some of these things are training items, others are things that
I do in terms of configuration and, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IMHO&lt;/span&gt;, should be &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OS&lt;/span&gt;/distro defaults
(unless you know some esoteric hidden switch to change&amp;nbsp;them).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disable graphical login as root. This enforces proper use of sudo,
    and also prevents a user from becoming lazy and operating as root on
    a regular&amp;nbsp;basis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pick a good, strong root password. Write it down on a post-it note
    and keep it somewhere near the computer. (Yes, I know what you&amp;#8217;re
    thinking. But if it&amp;#8217;s a home computer, anyone already in the house
    either is trusted, or will own the computer one way or another. I&amp;#8217;d
    rather have everyone in the house have access to the box, than a
    password that a remote attacker can easily brute&amp;nbsp;force.)*&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disable caching of sudo passwords in the desktop manager, if it
    already isn&amp;#8217;t done. This is a &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; bad idea, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IMHO&lt;/span&gt;, and
    effectively defeats privilege separation. If someone needs to use
    sudo &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; often, they&amp;#8217;re either a knowledgeable user, or they&amp;#8217;re
    doing something&amp;nbsp;wrong.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set the package manager to use the strictest key verification&amp;nbsp;settings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provide the user with extensive documentation (can be a list of
    links to helpful sites) that includes - &lt;em&gt;this is of paramount
    importance&lt;/em&gt; - a list of common Windows (or whatever &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OS&lt;/span&gt; they&amp;#8217;re
    coming from) programs and their closest Linux equivalents. This is
    another measure to try and dissuade the user from searching for and
    installing arbitrary&amp;nbsp;code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Give the user a good, simple explanation of what sudo is, what root
    is, and why they should be worried. One of my analogies - if I have
    time to explain it - is to think of the computer&amp;#8217;s security like a
    jewlery store. Your user account is the front door; only people who
    look honest are buzzed in, but they still can&amp;#8217;t do much damage. The
    root password is the combination to the vault; only very trusted
    people can get in, and they only open it when they absolutely have&amp;nbsp;to.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enable a wide range of trusted repositories by default. The more
    likely the user is to find a package in the repos already cached,
    the less likely they are to download arbitrary&amp;nbsp;code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Explain to the user that when you install software (as root), you&amp;#8217;re
    essentially giving the developer access to your system. Software
    should be screened by someone who knows what they&amp;#8217;re doing (i.e. the
    community) before you install&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I always tell people to *only* install software from the
    repositories I enable. If there&amp;#8217;s something they need and it isn&amp;#8217;t
    available, ask me (or ask the community) and I&amp;#8217;ll make a package and
    upload it to a suitable repository. The key here - and the most
    difficult part - is to conquer the Windows habit of installing
    software from disparate sources, and train the user that only
    software from their repositories, or other community-standard
    repositories, can be&amp;nbsp;trusted.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Show the user the correct patch/update procedure for their system.
    Depending on skill level and the level of attention you&amp;#8217;re willing
    to give them, it might be advisable to enable automatic updates (if
    the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OS&lt;/span&gt; doesn&amp;#8217;t have a way to do it, then via&amp;nbsp;cron).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the user is a developer or needs to run any services, even just
    for development - i.e. Apache, MySQL, Postfix, etc. - properly
    secure them and give an overview &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; links to the proper security&amp;nbsp;procedures.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Setup a second user account. Explain to the user that this is &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt;
    to be used for banking and other sensitive activities. Lock it down,
    make sure it&amp;#8217;s in a different group from the main user, don&amp;#8217;t
    install any Firefox&amp;nbsp;plugins.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfotunately, a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of this is just breaking the bad administration
and security habits shared by most Windows&amp;nbsp;users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we&amp;#8217;re on the topic, a word about package managers. I&amp;#8217;m a Linux
sysadmin, and I believe in &amp;#8216;eating your own dog food&amp;#8217;. I&amp;#8217;ve used Linux
on all of my servers, desktops, and laptops for over 4 years now. I
haven&amp;#8217;t used Windows on a regular basis in ages. I&amp;#8217;d say I touch a
Windows box for about 5 minutes a month, and usually just to use a
browser. A few weeks ago, I was asked to install Windows on a desktop
for someone. I did. I then attempted to install Firefox. Using what I
remembered of Windows, I navigated to the &amp;#8220;Control Panel&amp;#8221; and clicked
(err&amp;#8230; double clicked) on &amp;#8220;Add and Remove Programs&amp;#8221;. Seems logical
enough. I then stared at the screen for about 30 seconds, trying to find
the Search box, where I could type in &amp;#8220;Firefox&amp;#8221;. Finally, I literally
began laughing out loud, when I remembered that Windows doesn&amp;#8217;t have
unified package management, and I&amp;#8217;d need to manually find the Firefox
binary on their web site, download it, and run whatever installer
program Firefox chooses to use. Same issue with updating software. I&amp;#8217;m
utterly perplexed, being a Linux user, that Windows and Mac people still
search through Google or multiple web sites just to find new software.
I&amp;#8217;m even more perplexed that the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OS&lt;/span&gt; update/patch program doesn&amp;#8217;t also
update all of the software on the system. It seems like the stone&amp;nbsp;ages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, one of the biggest failings of modern Linux package
management is the assumption (derived from multi-user systems) that all
software should be installed system-wide. Granted, it doesn&amp;#8217;t do a whole
lot to actually protect a single user if they install malicious software
available to just themselves (especially since most desktop installs
these days are probably used as single-user systems), but I really feel
that distros (especially desktop-oriented distros) should have an option
to easily install packages for just the current user, and possibly do
this by&amp;nbsp;default.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#8217;t find the link right now, but I did find an interesting
article on Microsoft&amp;#8217;s old anti-Linux campaign (&amp;#8220;get the facts&amp;#8221;). One of
the things mentioned was that when Microsoft compared &amp;#8220;vulnerability
counts&amp;#8221;, they were actually comparing: 1) entire Linux distros vs just
the core Windows &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OS&lt;/span&gt;, and 2) counting individual patches in Linux versus
patch sets released by &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MS&lt;/span&gt;. So, not only was &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MS&lt;/span&gt; literally counting apples
and oranges, but they were totally ignoring unfixed vulnerabilities.
Given Microsoft&amp;#8217;s habit of not fixing vulnerabilities - especially in
&amp;#8220;unsupported&amp;#8221; products - it&amp;#8217;s no wonder how they got the numbers to look
so&amp;nbsp;good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, here&amp;#8217;s a thought. People are used to paying for an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OS&lt;/span&gt; and for
software. Start a Linux vendor that sells a desktop, newbie-oriented
Linux distro. Charge a per-user flat rate for the distro and a bunch of
base packages, that includes X hours of telephone support. Charge per
hour/minute/whatever for additional support. Bundle in secure &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VNC&lt;/span&gt;,
secure remote access, etc. in a way that will allow support to remotely
access the computer, but preserve the privacy and security of the user
(perhaps an app that allows the user to initiate a reverse &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VNC&lt;/span&gt; or &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SSH&lt;/span&gt;
session to support). Lock down root access - allow the user to do it,
but remind them every time that, outside of a specified set of commands,
their actions will be logged and won&amp;#8217;t get full support. Then figure out
a way for support to write a shell script that&amp;#8217;s sent to the user to
perform administrative actions, which will all be listed in relatively
simple terms for the user to examine and approve. Finally, have a
&lt;em&gt;giant&lt;/em&gt; package repo, all of which is free or comes with paid support.
Any F/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;OSS&lt;/span&gt; packages that aren&amp;#8217;t already in the repo can be requested by a
customer, and for a flat fee for the first requesting customer (say,
$10) will be examined, approved, packaged, and added to the&amp;nbsp;repo.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">admin</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 03 Dec 2009 17:34:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>tag:blog.jasonantman.com,2009-12-03:2009/12/book-comments-the-future-of-the-internet-and-how-to-stop-it-by-jonathan-zittrain/</guid><category>book</category><category>freedom</category><category>internet</category></item><item><title>Android links - maps, dial a phone number</title><link>http://blog.jasonantman.com/2009/11/android-links-maps-dial-a-phone-number/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;ve used Google search from an Android device to search for a
business, you&amp;#8217;ve probably noticed the two interesting &amp;#8220;buttons&amp;#8221; to the
right of the search listing - &amp;#8220;Get Directions&amp;#8221; and a button for the
phone number. It turns out, these are pretty easy to&amp;nbsp;implement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &amp;#8220;Get Directions&amp;#8221; link is a simple link to &lt;a href="http://maps.google.com"&gt;Google
Maps&lt;/a&gt; like &lt;a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?daddr=42+Pierce+Ave,+Midland+Park,+NJ+07432"&gt;This
One&lt;/a&gt;.
The links are actually pretty&amp;nbsp;simple:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilite"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;href=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;http://maps.google.com/maps?daddr=42+Pierce+Ave%2C+Midland+Park%2C+&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NJ&lt;/span&gt;+07432&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Get Directions&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It just uses a regular Google Maps &lt;span class="caps"&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt;, with the destination address
encoded. When the link is clicked in the Android browser, a dialog pops
up asking the user whether he wants to open it with the browser or the
Maps application. If Maps is selected, it automatically opens with the
address from the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt; in the destination input box, the phone&amp;#8217;s current
location as the start input, and gives easy access to directions and&amp;nbsp;navigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The telephone links are a bit more interesting. Apparently, the Android
browser uses the Phone app to handle the &amp;#8220;tel&amp;#8221; scheme, as defined by
&lt;a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3966"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;RFC&lt;/span&gt; 3966&lt;/a&gt;.Therefore, clicking a
link&amp;nbsp;like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilite"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="na"&gt;href=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;tel:2015555555&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;201-555-5555&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;on Android will bring up the Phone app and pre-enter the digits for
2015555555. Luckily, it doesn&amp;#8217;t automatically dial the number. If you
want to give it a try and are using Android:
&lt;a href="tel:2015555555"&gt;201-555-5555&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final step is how to implement this. I don&amp;#8217;t know if most mobile
browsers (Blackberry? iPhone?) also support the &amp;#8220;tel&amp;#8221; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;URI&lt;/span&gt; scheme, or how
they&amp;#8217;ll handle Google Maps links. But if you&amp;#8217;re looking to include
Android-specific content, the user agent string from my Motorola Droid
(Android 2.0) looks&amp;nbsp;like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilite"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;Mozilla/5.0 (Linux; U;Android 2.0; en-us; Droid Build/ESD20) AppleWebKit/530.17 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/4.0 Mobile Safari/530.17
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I know that there are a number of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt; classes out there to detect
browsers (like &lt;a href="http://chrisschuld.com/projects/browser-php-detecting-a-users-browser-from-php/"&gt;Chris Schuld&amp;#8217;s
browser.php&lt;/a&gt;)
and some things to detect mobile device capabilities (like
&lt;a href="http://wurfl.sourceforge.net/nphp/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;WURFL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://freshmeat.net/projects/tera_wurfl/"&gt;Tera
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;WURFL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, both using the
&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wurfl"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;WURFL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; data). However, if you just
need to know whether your user is on Android or not, I&amp;#8217;d personally
recommend just checking the user agent string for &amp;#8220;Linux&amp;#8221;, &amp;#8220;Android&amp;#8221; and
&amp;#8220;WebKit&amp;#8221; until a better browser identification system is found, as these
are not likely to change in the near&amp;nbsp;future.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">admin</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 22 Nov 2009 10:25:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>tag:blog.jasonantman.com,2009-11-22:2009/11/android-links-maps-dial-a-phone-number/</guid><category>android</category><category>google</category><category>html</category></item><item><title>Droid Camera problem solved</title><link>http://blog.jasonantman.com/2009/11/droid-camera-problem-solved/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Gizmodo - &lt;a href="http://gizmodo.com/5407482/the-real-reason-the-droids-camera-fixed-itself"&gt;The Real Reason the Droid&amp;#8217;s Camera Fixed

&lt;p&gt;Well, it&amp;#8217;s definitely good news to know that the problem with the camera
on my beautiful new Droid is only a software issue. However it&amp;#8217;s not too
reassuring to know that Google (or could it have been Motorola devs?)

two days off of work - plus the weekend. Minus personal commitments,
that&amp;#8217;s about two full (call it 16 hour) days to get some work done.
While I have lots of things that could use my attention - a number of
neglected projects, my big new PHPsa project, and some server
consolidation at home - I&amp;#8217;ve decided to dedicate the time to Android&amp;nbsp;development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve got the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ADK&lt;/span&gt; installed and running, and the emulator is wonderful
(especially with the Droid skin). And I know it&amp;#8217;s wrong, but I think I&amp;#8217;m
going to be developing the first app for Android 2.0 (especially given
the new
&lt;a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/provider/ContactsContract.html"&gt;ContactsContract&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; in&amp;nbsp;5).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m having a few issues with &lt;a href="http://subclipse.tigris.org/"&gt;Subclipse&lt;/a&gt;,
even on the latest OpenSuSE 11.1, and still have a few things I want to
do on the phone&amp;#8230; but hopefully I&amp;#8217;ll have a beta build of the app by
the end of the weekend. I&amp;#8217;ve already done most of the data modeling and
sketched out the&amp;nbsp;storyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m not going to say much about what the app is until it&amp;#8217;s ready, but
it&amp;#8217;s something targeted at people like me - SysAdmins with way too many
things on their plate for their number of waking&amp;nbsp;hours.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">admin</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 12 Nov 2009 01:35:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>tag:blog.jasonantman.com,2009-11-12:2009/11/weekend-of-code-android/</guid><category>android</category><category>google</category></item><item><title>Droid!</title><link>http://blog.jasonantman.com/2009/11/droid/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t like writing posts with a low useful content quotient, but here&amp;nbsp;goes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After having only one new (i.e. not used) phone in eight years - and the
one new one was a Treo 700p, obsolete when I bought it - I decided to
bite the bullet. I bought a Droid! While I was almost dead-set on it
before I even held it in the store, my feelings of love at first sight
were even more clear when I started to play around with&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, here&amp;#8217;s a little overview of what I did first, what my
plans/questions are, and what&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First&amp;nbsp;minutes/day:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unpack everything and start to figure things out. Test phone, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SMS&lt;/span&gt;,&amp;nbsp;data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Setup &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IMAP&lt;/span&gt; email for my personal account (need to look into&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;IMAP&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;IDLE&lt;/span&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go through the entire Settings menu and try to set things up. Find
    out that the default apps can&amp;#8217;t be removed. The app screen, by
    default, is pretty&amp;nbsp;full&amp;#8230;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Export my contacts from my Palm (no sync cable, had to use
    &lt;a href="http://php-pdb.sourceforge.net/"&gt;php-pdb&lt;/a&gt; to export a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CSV&lt;/span&gt;, then
    manually edit &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ALL&lt;/span&gt; of them in&amp;nbsp;Gmail.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So after having the phone for about 12 hours, here&amp;#8217;s what I&amp;#8217;ve installed
on&amp;nbsp;it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Listen (Google Labs)&lt;/strong&gt; - Great podcatcher app. The speaker is a
    bit too quiet for easy listening on the drive to work, so I&amp;#8217;ll need
    to get one of those &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FM&lt;/span&gt; radio&amp;nbsp;interfaces.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AnyCut&lt;/strong&gt; - allows creation of arbitrary shortcuts on the desktop,
    including direct&amp;nbsp;dial.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ConnectBot&lt;/strong&gt; - full-featured &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SSH&lt;/span&gt; client including key-based auth
    and storage of multiple user/host&amp;nbsp;settings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meebo &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IM&lt;/span&gt; client. It does &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AIM&lt;/span&gt;, which is nice, but doesn&amp;#8217;t do&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;IRC&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Android Battery Dog&lt;/strong&gt; - App that graphs battery voltage,
    temperature, capacity over time and also stores a simple &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CSV&lt;/span&gt; log
    (which I intend to parse out later for historical&amp;nbsp;data).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bookmarking for Delicious&lt;/strong&gt; - Allows saving of bookmarks to
    &lt;a href="del.icio.us"&gt;del.icio.us&lt;/a&gt; (but not&amp;nbsp;retrieval).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To Do List&lt;/strong&gt; - A very simple To Do list app, until I find
    something that works with Google Tasks. No&amp;nbsp;syncing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VoiceMemo (JavaCodeLand.com)&lt;/strong&gt; - A really simple voice memo&amp;nbsp;app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WiFinder (PGMsoft)&lt;/strong&gt; - Pretty much useless. Shows a scan of WiFi
    networks, but only shows encryption, channel number, and signal
    strength in&amp;nbsp;bars.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The few problems I&amp;#8217;ve noticed so&amp;nbsp;far:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The touch-sensitive buttons along the bottom row (specifically the
    search button) seem to be right where my thumb wants to rest when
    holding the phone in landscape&amp;nbsp;mode.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As others have mentioned, the camera quality isn&amp;#8217;t great, but it&amp;#8217;s
    much better than my Treo&amp;nbsp;700p.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My list for future&amp;nbsp;research/development:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;WAP&lt;/span&gt; pages for my web-based personal finance app, fuel log,&amp;nbsp;etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;IMAP&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;IDLE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tasks/to do app that syncs with Google&amp;nbsp;Tasks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A &lt;a href="http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596007836"&gt;Cycle System&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to quickly mute all sounds on the&amp;nbsp;phone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to do tones by person or group for not only ringtones (phone)
    but also &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SMS&lt;/span&gt;, Email, etc. Also, a way to set certain hours of the
    day when audible alerts will be disabled, other than a specified
    whitelist (email, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SMS&lt;/span&gt;,&amp;nbsp;etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Verizon Visual&amp;nbsp;Voicemail&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do some development with the geolocation &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JS&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Console on the&amp;nbsp;phone?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SCP&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SFTP&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;program.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TV&lt;/span&gt; listings (perhaps a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WAP&lt;/span&gt; version of my script that pulls from
    &lt;a href="http://www.schedulesdirect.org/"&gt;SchedulesDirect&lt;/a&gt; (unfortunately,
    due to their redistribution policy, this is a private, authenticated&amp;nbsp;page).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nagios&amp;nbsp;checker/notifier&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;RSS&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;reader&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;WAP&lt;/span&gt; page for &lt;a href="http://www.php-ems-tools.com"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EMS&lt;/span&gt; Tools&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;callin.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to handle &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IMAP&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;folders?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Script to backup Gmail contacts, other data stored with&amp;nbsp;Google.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thunderbird Gmail contact&amp;nbsp;sync.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A wifi scanner/survey software that shows all of the important stuff
    like signal strength in dbm, noise floor,&amp;nbsp;etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Something like kismet that integrates the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPS&lt;/span&gt; and wifi&amp;nbsp;scanning.&lt;/li&gt;

to those proportions yet. But any new platform will have its hiccups,
and Google is relatively new to the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OS&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, here&amp;#8217;s the news. Google issued a legal Cease and Desist order to a
developer Steve Kondik (known as
&lt;a href="http://twitter.com/cyanogen"&gt;Cyanogen&lt;/a&gt;). The story goes something like
this&amp;#8230; Steve is an active Android developer, doing a lot of work on the
lower-level stuff (lower level than apps), including multi-touch and
more home screens. His changes are essentially at the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OS&lt;/span&gt;-level, and
Android doesn&amp;#8217;t have a full-fledged package management/patching
mechanism like Linux distros, so making use of them requires recompiling
stuff and re-flashing the device with a new &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ROM&lt;/span&gt; image (since the
installation apps can&amp;#8217;t handle stuff this low-level). Here&amp;#8217;s the rub: in
order to work on a device, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ROM&lt;/span&gt; image needs to include both
closed-source Google apps and proprietary (device manufacturer) drivers.
While these apps and drivers are available for download, the license
terms prohibit redistribution. But in order for Steve to create a
fully-functional &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ROM&lt;/span&gt; image, he has to include the closed&amp;nbsp;code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some writeups on this at &lt;a href="http://www.linux-mag.com/cache/7544/1.html"&gt;Linux
Magazine&lt;/a&gt; and a good, timely
analysis at &lt;a href="http://www.linuxinsider.com/rsstory/68237.html?wlc=1254230361"&gt;Linux
Insider&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#8217;s also a clarification by Google&amp;#8217;s Dan Morrill on the &lt;a href="http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2009/09/note-on-google-apps-for-android.html"&gt;Android
Developers&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what&amp;#8217;s my take on all this (not that another guy taking about this
is&amp;nbsp;needed)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, I think this is relatively minor. The community will work
around it, whether with Google&amp;#8217;s blessing or not. The bigger issue
that&amp;#8217;s coming to light is the fact that Google isn&amp;#8217;t simply altruistic,
they&amp;#8217;re a for-profit entity. They have every right to be, and they have
every right to exercise some amount of control over Android. The
community needs to realize that Android isn&amp;#8217;t a silver bullet, and isn&amp;#8217;t
even the Linux of the phone world. On the other hand, Google needs to
realize two important facts: 1) the openness of Android is what&amp;#8217;s
driving developers to it, and they need to do all they can to continue
that, and 2) most of those developers are flat-out used to running Linux
with an all-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPL&lt;/span&gt; system, and aren&amp;#8217;t used to the concept of not being able
to roll their own&amp;nbsp;distribution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what&amp;#8217;s my&amp;nbsp;advice?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google should further decouple their Apps from the Android platform.
    Specifically, instead of requiring users to back things up, they
    should provide a redistributable application that installs their
    other apps. &lt;em&gt;Allow a user to flash a bare-bones community &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ROM&lt;/span&gt; image,
    and then pull whatever else they want from Google.&lt;/em&gt; If Google
    intends on toeing the line that Android is Free but the (Google)
    Apps aren&amp;#8217;t, then Google should provide an acceptable means for
    users of community &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ROM&lt;/span&gt; images to easily and painlessly re-install
    the closed Google apps on that&amp;nbsp;image.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google should require that handset manufacturers do the same. Create
    a redistributable application that can be part of community &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ROM&lt;/span&gt;
    images, which will (via tethering or whatever) download and install
    any proprietary device-specific drivers that are&amp;nbsp;needed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bottom line of my opinion - it&amp;#8217;s fine if Google exercises their full
control over their own closed apps. But they should provide an avenue
for non-technical end-users to easily upgrade a community (i.e. Free)
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ROM&lt;/span&gt; image with the expected Google Apps and device manufacturer&amp;nbsp;software.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">admin</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 29 Sep 2009 08:44:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:blog.jasonantman.com,2009-09-29:2009/09/first-big-android-fisaco/</guid><category>android</category><category>google</category></item><item><title>Dealing with unplanned downtime - productively</title><link>http://blog.jasonantman.com/2009/09/dealing-with-unplanned-downtime-productively/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;While I&amp;#8217;ve read and really appreciate &lt;a href="http://whatexit.org/tal/"&gt;Tom
Limoncelli&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8216;s &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/o/ASIN/0596007833/tomontime-20"&gt;Time Management for System
Administrators&lt;/a&gt;,
the current state of my life (mainly that it&amp;#8217;s split between work,
personal projects, a freelance client, administering the systems of a
the &lt;a href="http://www.midlandparkambulance.com"&gt;ambulance corps&lt;/a&gt; and real
people, and that my &amp;#8220;work day&amp;#8221; is whenever I&amp;#8217;m awake) has prevented me
from really implementing most of the advice. However, I do try to be as
productive as I&amp;nbsp;can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without getting into details, a few weeks ago, $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;WORK&lt;/span&gt; suffered a major
electrical failure that required everything in the data center to be
powered down. This happened around 10:30 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AM&lt;/span&gt;, and the majority of groups
simply powered down their machines and left, planning to return around 2
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AM&lt;/span&gt; (the estimated power restoration time). After getting our machines
down and stopping for pizza, I remembered how much of a pain it was to
work in the racks bringing everything down. While my group only has two
racks, we&amp;#8217;ve had a lot of changeover lately, and the cabling had gotten
quote messy. Noting this, I mentioned it to my two higher-ups,
remembering that we had a stock of assorted length patch cables. We were
able to make an &amp;#8220;emergency&amp;#8221; run to our cable vendor and pick up a box of
1- 2- and 3-foot power&amp;nbsp;cables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While everyone else was home or in their offices dodging the pieces of
falling sky (everything was down including VoIP and mail), we were the
only group getting real productive work done in the data center. The
power failure, rather than a catastrophic event, was a great opportunity
- the only time we could pull &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; cable in a production rack and
re-do all power and&amp;nbsp;patches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, here&amp;#8217;s my &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SA&lt;/span&gt; tip for the day - everyone has some big projects that
they&amp;#8217;d like to do, require downtime, but aren&amp;#8217;t critical enough to
schedule something. So, keep a list of these and have the parts on hand.
Whether it&amp;#8217;s a &amp;#8220;just in case&amp;#8221; hardware swap-out, re-patching, or
anything else, eventually you (depending on the environment that you
work in) might have one of those times when the solution to the problem
is out of your hands and there&amp;#8217;s nothing else to do. Use this time&amp;nbsp;productively.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">admin</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 17 Sep 2009 12:50:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:blog.jasonantman.com,2009-09-17:2009/09/dealing-with-unplanned-downtime-productively/</guid><category>sysadmin</category><category>time management</category></item><item><title>Apache holding strong, IIS declining</title><link>http://blog.jasonantman.com/2009/07/apache-holding-strong-iis-declining/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;According to the latest (June 2009) &lt;a href="http://news.netcraft.com/archives/2009/06/17/june_2009_web_server_survey.html"&gt;NetCraft web server
survey&lt;/a&gt;,
the Free/Open Source &lt;a href="http://httpd.apache.org/"&gt;Apache web server&lt;/a&gt; is
now hosting 50.46% of all active web sites surveyed (about 38 Million).
Microsoft&amp;#8217;s &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IIS&lt;/span&gt; server is at 28.05% (or about 29 Million) - a 7.64%
decline from &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IIS&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s May 2009 statistics. Interestingly, Google holds
12.2%, presumably most of that is their own content or content generated
by their&amp;nbsp;applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is nothing new - both Free/Open Source software and Unix-related
stuff has always had a stronger share in the server (and Internet)
market than Microsoft products. And, despite all of Microsoft&amp;#8217;s
&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear,_uncertainty_and_doubt"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;FUD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, it&amp;#8217;s
clear that Apache is still more popular than &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IIS&lt;/span&gt; by a large margin -
probably in no small part due to the extendability and scalability of
Apache, and its security record (just take a look at the difference in
&lt;a href="http://www.gauravv.com/2009/01/14/difference-between-apache-and-iis/"&gt;system
calls&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real shining example, however, comes from looking at the stats on
the Internet&amp;#8217;s million busiest sites - 66.26% running Apache and only
18.77% running &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IIS&lt;/span&gt;, which has been constant for the better part of the
last year. That says quite a bit about the stability and scalability of
Apache. Not to mention that a lot of the really big sites run their own
custom-modified versions of Apache which may or may not be identified as
Apache in a&amp;nbsp;survey.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">admin</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 23 Jul 2009 14:23:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:blog.jasonantman.com,2009-07-23:2009/07/apache-holding-strong-iis-declining/</guid><category>apache</category><category>iis</category><category>web server</category></item><item><title>DNS - Open Source rules</title><link>http://blog.jasonantman.com/2009/07/dns-open-source-rules/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DNS&lt;/span&gt; is arguably one of the most important services on the Internet.
Without it, every domain name and email address we know would be
meaningless. We&amp;#8217;d be thrown back into the days of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IP&lt;/span&gt; addresses without
corresponding names. And, given everything that depends on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DNS&lt;/span&gt;, it&amp;#8217;s
also one of the most important services from a security standpoint.
Compromised &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DNS&lt;/span&gt; servers could cause end-of-the-world havoc for whatever
zones they&amp;nbsp;control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here&amp;#8217;s a fact that Microsoft and the other proprietary guys don&amp;#8217;t
want you to know: &lt;strong&gt;58.65% of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DNS&lt;/span&gt; servers that are listed as being
authoritative for .com or .net domains are running the free/open source
&lt;a href="https://www.isc.org/software/BIND/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISC&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BIND&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Less than 0.3% are using
a Microsoft product&lt;/strong&gt;. To me, that says&amp;nbsp;something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is according to the October 2008 &lt;a href="http://dns.measurement-factory.com/surveys/200810.html"&gt;measurement factory &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DNS&lt;/span&gt; server
survey&lt;/a&gt; of 99+
Million addresses (618,000+&amp;nbsp;hosts).&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">admin</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 23 Jul 2009 13:37:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:blog.jasonantman.com,2009-07-23:2009/07/dns-open-source-rules/</guid><category>bind</category><category>dns</category><category>market share</category></item><item><title>Problems with TheAntennaFarm.com</title><link>http://blog.jasonantman.com/2009/07/problems-with-theantennafarmcom/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;When I did the &lt;a href="/2009/07/update-on-my-f-250-icom-mobile-antennas-strobes/"&gt;communications upgrades to my
truck&lt;/a&gt;,
I was originally going to order the antennas and mounts from
&lt;a href="http://www.tessco.com/"&gt;Tessco&lt;/a&gt;, but I found that &lt;a href="http://www.theantennafarm.com"&gt;The Antenna
Farm&lt;/a&gt; in Montana had the best price on
the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IC&lt;/span&gt;-F5061, and also carried the antennas and mounts. I must first say
that there was a notice on the Antenna Farm web site that they had moved
to a new location a few days before I placed my order. I waited to place
my order until the web site stated that things were shipping&amp;nbsp;normally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I placed my order, I added in the &amp;#8220;notes&amp;#8221; field that I would like
tracking numbers sent to me as soon as they were available, as I had
requested &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UPS&lt;/span&gt; shipping. I received an initial order confirmation. After
waiting a few days, I had received neither a confirmation that my card
was charged nor a tracking number. The order status on their web site
was still listed as &amp;#8220;processing&amp;#8221;. I called back four days after placing
my order, and it took five calls over two days to get anything other
than an answering machine. When I finally got through to John (the owner
and, as far as I can tell, sole employee), the voice quality of their
phone line was so poor I could hardly communicate. I got enough of his
end of the conversation to understand that I should email him, which I
did (for the second or third time). In the email, I stated that I was
having the equipment installed, so I really needed to know when it would
arrive in order to schedule an&amp;nbsp;installation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I placed the order early on a Monday morning. After numerous attempts to
make contact, and no change in the &amp;#8220;processing&amp;#8221; status on the web site,
I finally got an email back on Thursday afternoon stating that some of
the antenna mounts were out of stock, and part of the order would be
drop shipped from the distributor, and should be there the next day.
Still no mention of a tracking number, which I had requested numerous
times. I&amp;#8217;ve done quite a bit of selling on Ebay, and know how easy it is
to provide a customer with this information. He also stated that the
high frequency antenna mount for the WiFI antenna was out of stock at
the distributor as well, so he had them make up a more expensive one at
no extra&amp;nbsp;cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drop ship box arrived the next day, Friday. It contained the two
antennas (I ordered the WiFi antenna directly from L-Com) and two
antenna mounts - *one* of the Antenex &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MB8X&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s, and the high frequency
mount for the WiFi antenna. The WiFi &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NMO&lt;/span&gt; mount was &lt;em&gt;definitelty&lt;/em&gt; not the
one I ordered. I know John incurred extra cost in having them custom add
a connector, but it didn&amp;#8217;t look like any &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NMO&lt;/span&gt; mount I had ever seen (it
appeared to accept a pin in the center, as opposed to having a flat disc
to make&amp;nbsp;contact).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next week, on Tuesday, the Icom radio arrived. It was as ordered,
but the second Antenex &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MB8X&lt;/span&gt; was nowhere to be found. I did finally
receive a tracking number about 24 hours prior to&amp;nbsp;delivery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two weeks after I placed my order (with three day &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UPS&lt;/span&gt; shipping),
&lt;a href="http://kensautoelectric.com/"&gt;Ken&lt;/a&gt; managed to fit me in early in the
morning. I told him about the missing third antenna mount, and he agreed
to use one from his stock. Much to my dismay, when he dropped off the
truck, I learned that *neither* of the antenna mounts that arrived
were true &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NMO&lt;/span&gt; mounts, and thus they were both&amp;nbsp;useless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, I&amp;#8217;m horribly disappointed with The Antenna Farm. The lack of
communication is appalling, regardless of whether they&amp;#8217;re having
telephone problems or not (and I find it hard to believe that this guy
doesn&amp;#8217;t have a cell phone, or can&amp;#8217;t setup something VoIP-based). The
online feedback on order status is nonexistent, and I might as well have
had it shipped &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USPS&lt;/span&gt;, because I only got one tracking number and that was
a mere day before delivery. One of three antenna mounts was never
received (though John did refund me the cost) and the other two were not
as specified. He clearly has no idea how to deal with someone who
actually has a timeframe - perhaps normal for someone who does most of
his business with hams and not public safety (I guess that&amp;#8217;s my fault
for choosing a bad vendor). When he found out that there would be delays
in fulfilling my order, John should have contacted me and asked me how I
wanted to proceed. The bulk of my order was drop shipped from Tessco,
who I&amp;#8217;ve done business with before and would have been more than happy
to order direct&amp;nbsp;from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The programming kit for the F5061 that I ordered from The Antenna Farm,
which was listed as &amp;#8220;you buy the cable, we throw in the software&amp;#8221;,
arrived as a loose cable in the radio box and a home-burned &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CD&lt;/span&gt;, without
even any writing on it to say what it was, with a simple zip file of the
installer. I don&amp;#8217;t know what Icom&amp;#8217;s licensing agreement is, but I doubt
they&amp;#8217;d be happy about this, as the software isn&amp;#8217;t available on their web&amp;nbsp;site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To top it all off, I was told by my installer that he stopped buying
from The Antenna Farm a few years ago due to endless&amp;nbsp;problems.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">admin</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 14 Jul 2009 00:33:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:blog.jasonantman.com,2009-07-14:2009/07/problems-with-theantennafarmcom/</guid><category>antennafarm</category><category>communications</category><category>EMS</category><category>radio</category></item><item><title>Update on my F-250 - Icom mobile, antennas, strobes</title><link>http://blog.jasonantman.com/2009/07/update-on-my-f-250-icom-mobile-antennas-strobes/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve done a bit of work on my truck since my last update, and also have

I was up until 5 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AM&lt;/span&gt; or so working on
implementing &lt;a href="http://reductivelabs.com/trac/puppet/"&gt;Puppet&lt;/a&gt; at home.
I&amp;#8217;m building two new boxes - a storage (centralized home
directory)/syslog (to MySQL) server and a second web server (possibly
also to handle Nagios) - and I decided that they&amp;#8217;ll be totally built by
Puppet. The only thing I had to give up on was setting up the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NFS&lt;/span&gt; share
for my home directory on the new storage box and installing and testing
&lt;a href="http://www.rsyslog.com/"&gt;rsyslog&lt;/a&gt; on&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This afternoon around 7, I started on my weekend projects for &lt;a href="http://www.midlandparkambulance.com"&gt;the
ambulance corps&lt;/a&gt; - setting up
&lt;a href="http://www.nagios.org"&gt;Nagios&lt;/a&gt; to receive &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SNMP&lt;/span&gt; traps from the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;APC&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UPS&lt;/span&gt;
and moving over to the new &lt;a href="http://www.vyatta.org"&gt;Vyatta&lt;/a&gt;-based router
(from &lt;a href="http://m0n0.ch/wall/"&gt;m0n0wall&lt;/a&gt;). I&amp;#8217;d attempted the router
before, but had to rollback - I&amp;#8217;m using an old
&lt;a href="http://www.bluesocket.com/"&gt;BlueSocket&lt;/a&gt; controller for hardware - it&amp;#8217;s
just a nice black 1U enclosure with a stock Intel motherboard, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;20GB&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HDD&lt;/span&gt;,
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;512MB&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RAM&lt;/span&gt; and three 10/100 NICs. The first time, I was unable to get
link on either of the two NICs I was using, so I decided to&amp;nbsp;rollback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nagios &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SNMP&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;Traps&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found a good starting point for Nagios &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SNMP&lt;/span&gt; traps on the &lt;a href="http://altinity.blogs.com/dotorg/2006/03/lessons_in_snmp.html"&gt;OpsView
blog&lt;/a&gt;. I
setup `snmptrapd` on the Nagios server and hacked together a little
Python script to just write all of the traps to a file. After some
testing with `snmptrap` on my laptop, I did a test by pulling the
power plug of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UPS&lt;/span&gt;, waiting about 30 seconds, and then plugging it
back in. Sure enough, the little old &lt;a href="/2007/03/apc-ap9605-powernet-snmp-card/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AP9605&lt;/span&gt; PowerNet &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SNMP&lt;/span&gt;
card&lt;/a&gt;
generated two &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SNMP&lt;/span&gt; traps - one for power loss and one for power regained
- both of which showed up in the test&amp;nbsp;file&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step will be deciding how to get the traps into Nagios -
specifically whether I want to go with something heavy-weight, like
&lt;a href="http://snmptt.sourceforge.net/"&gt;SNMPtt&lt;/a&gt; that can handle other devices,
or whether I want to code a simple script myself just to deal with the
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;APC&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;cards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Router&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main reason why I wanted to make the switch from m0n0 to Vyatta was
to ease the setup and maintenance of an IPsec tunnel from the ambulance
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;HQ&lt;/span&gt; to my house, so I could push backups (relatively small) over the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WAN&lt;/span&gt;
to my infrastructure (or, rather, have Bacula pull the backups). Another
big bonus was finally having a way of configuring and checking things
through &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SSH&lt;/span&gt; without having to port-forward a web &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GUI&lt;/span&gt;. Another bonus of
having a real Linux system under the router is the ability to make
custom Nagios check scripts and easily execute them. Something I hadn&amp;#8217;t
thought of - but became obvious during the switchover - is the ability
to run full-fledged `tcpdump` on the router&amp;nbsp;itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After building the new config myself, and confirming that the system ran
in isolation, I moved it over to production. The first issue was a bit
of a thinko on my part - the interfaces on the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BSC&lt;/span&gt; are actually arranged
on the back of the box like eth0&amp;#8212;&amp;#8212;-eth2&amp;#8212;&amp;#8212;-eth1, so I originally had
the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LAN&lt;/span&gt; uplink in the wrong interface. After correcting that and waiting
for the network to stabilize, I noticed a total external connectivity
failure. After some troubleshooting - thanks to tcpdump on the router -
it occurred to me that the (ancient) cable modem needs to be rebooted
when the router &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MAC&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I honestly don&amp;#8217;t remember the other problems that I ran into, but
eventually I ended up getting almost-full functionality - and then a
total network outage. A tcpdump on my laptop showed some really really
weird &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BOOTP&lt;/span&gt; traffic with addresses of 255.255.255.255. After doing some
troubleshooting and monitoring port counters on the switch, I narrowed
it down to coming from a single Windows box and the wireless access
point. After shutting off both ports, things seemed to stabilize. I also
had some &amp;#8220;martian address&amp;#8221; issues with one of the boxes, but decided to
roll the box and that solved&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the next day or so, I&amp;#8217;ll be reconfiguring Nagios both at home and
at the ambulance corps to cope with the changes and add in the requisite
monitoring, and keep an eye on things. Assuming all goes well, I&amp;#8217;ll
power down the old router on&amp;nbsp;Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the home front, I&amp;#8217;ve moved over from my old storage machine to the
old one - essentially just the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NFS&lt;/span&gt; mount, and moved over a tarball of
everything else. I also added a 1000Base-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SX&lt;/span&gt; card to the new box, though
it appears that I&amp;#8217;m out of fiber patch cords. The old storage box was
brought down for the first time in about 3 years (aside from brief
outages for hardware upgrades or array rebuilds). Assuming I got
everything off of it, it will be relegated to the spares&amp;nbsp;pile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m going to make a serious effort to post on a daily basis, if only for
my own future reference. I should have the demo of
&lt;a href="http://rackman.jasonantman.com"&gt;RackMan&lt;/a&gt; out soon, and I&amp;#8217;m also about
to start on integrating it with Nathan Hubbard&amp;#8217;s
&lt;a href="http://www.machdb.org/"&gt;MachDB&lt;/a&gt; as well as a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt; script I wrote to pull
port names and MACs from Cisco switches and associate them with NICs in
machines. Hopefully I&amp;#8217;ll also have some interesting Puppet stuff out&amp;nbsp;soon.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">admin</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 27 Jun 2009 01:03:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:blog.jasonantman.com,2009-06-27:2009/06/daily-work-nagios-snmp-traps-vyatta-jasonantmancom-upgrades/</guid><category>apc</category><category>bluesocket</category><category>Nagios</category><category>snmp</category><category>vyatta</category></item><item><title>300 hits</title><link>http://blog.jasonantman.com/2009/05/300-hits/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I know I&amp;#8217;ve been letting my blog die off a bit lately, mainly due to the

&lt;p&gt;I happened to get a comment on one of my
&lt;a href="/2009/02/routhost-dns-problems-godaddy-and-security-through-obscurity/"&gt;posts&lt;/a&gt;
today, so I decided to take a peek at webalizer and see how things are
doing. Apparently, I&amp;#8217;m getting 300+ hits/day, including a quite nice
array of search queries. Unfortunately, due to the way I redid my
logging infrastructure, I don&amp;#8217;t have any historical data (and it seems
like the webalizer history is still broken, as I&amp;#8217;m only seeing data for
this month). But&amp;nbsp;cool!&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">admin</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 22 May 2009 00:12:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:blog.jasonantman.com,2009-05-22:2009/05/300-hits/</guid></item><item><title>Acer X233Hbid Review</title><link>http://blog.jasonantman.com/2009/05/acer-x233hbid-review/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I just bought myself a new monitor for my
&lt;a href="http://www.mythtv.org"&gt;MythTV&lt;/a&gt; box, as I&amp;#8217;ve moved my beautiful Acer
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AL2416W&lt;/span&gt; 24&amp;#8221;er to my new desktop. The chosen monitor, based on price,
reviews and features, is the Acer X233Hbid. It&amp;#8217;s a 23&amp;#8221; 16:9 (not 16:10)
monitor that runs at 1920x1080, provides true 1080p, and has an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HDMI&lt;/span&gt;
input (not that I&amp;#8217;d ever use a
&lt;a href="http://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2007/01/hdcp-screwing-fans-more-ways-ever"&gt;restricted&lt;/a&gt;
connection). After a few minutes of having it turned on and running, the
picture quality is quite nice, even with quite a bit of&amp;nbsp;glare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I have two major complaints within the first ten minutes of
unboxing&amp;nbsp;it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No real manual, nor an online copy&lt;/strong&gt;. The monitor comes only with
    a Quick Start Guide. There&amp;#8217;s no printed full manual. More
    distressingly, it isn&amp;#8217;t even listed in their list of monitor models
    on their Support site. There&amp;#8217;s no manual copy online either. There
    was a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CD&lt;/span&gt; provided with the user&amp;#8217;s manual on it. However, for a
    company that sells netbooks with no &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CD&lt;/span&gt; drive, this seems like quite
    a bad decision. But why, you ask, would I need a manual for my&amp;nbsp;monitor?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VESA&lt;/span&gt; mounting instructions&lt;/strong&gt; One of my main criteria in
    choosing a monitor was that it allow
    &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VESA_mount"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;VESA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; mounting, as I have
    my MythTV monitor on a monitor arm (easily adjustable angle so
    others in the room can see). The Acer X233Hbid has a 100x100mm &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VESA&lt;/span&gt;
    mounting space on the back. However, in a rare design mistake
    (unlike my 24&amp;#8221; Acer &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AL2416W&lt;/span&gt;), the monitor stand is two parts - one
    rectangular column about 4&amp;#8221; long attached to the back of the
    monitor, and a base with a column which mates with the one on the
    back of the monitor. Unfortunately, the column part on the back of
    the monitor came pre-attached, and there was no mention in the
    manual of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VESA&lt;/span&gt; mounting or how to remove the&amp;nbsp;column.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Column removal:&lt;/strong&gt; The part of the monitor base which ships attached to
the monitor is a fairly easy removal. Though I was originally worried
about breaking something on my beautiful new screen, I found two plastic
pieces on either side of the pre-attached part of the base which
appeared to be snap-in trim pieces. Prying them off with a screwdriver
revealed four screws which hold this piece to the monitor. Not only was
removal easy, but the trim pieces snapped back into place for a nice
clean&amp;nbsp;look.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">admin</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 18 May 2009 17:27:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:blog.jasonantman.com,2009-05-18:2009/05/acer-x233hbid-review/</guid><category>acer</category><category>cant fix stupid</category><category>monitor</category><category>review</category></item><item><title>OpenSuSE Internet2 Mirror</title><link>http://blog.jasonantman.com/2009/05/opensuse-internet2-mirror/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I just bought a &amp;#8220;new&amp;#8221; desktop - I was thinking of doing an insane &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AMD&lt;/span&gt;
Phenom &lt;span class="caps"&gt;II&lt;/span&gt; x4 940 (quad-core 3.0GHz) box - but I happened to find a used
machine from $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;WORK&lt;/span&gt;; a Dell Precision 470 workstation, dual Xeon Nocona
2.8GHz processors, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;4GB&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RAM&lt;/span&gt; (takes up to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;16GB&lt;/span&gt;). So, I need a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DVD&lt;/span&gt; of my
usual desktop distro (&lt;a href="http://www.opensuse.org"&gt;OpenSuSE&lt;/a&gt;) for x64.
Being that I&amp;#8217;m at work (&lt;a href="http://www.rutgers.edu"&gt;Rutgers Unviersity&lt;/a&gt;), I
figured the quickest thing would be to find an
&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet2"&gt;Internet2&lt;/a&gt; mirror, as Rutgers
has 400Gbps peering on&amp;nbsp;NJedgeNet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the &lt;a href="http://mirrors.opensuse.org/list/11.1.html"&gt;OpenSuSE Mirror
List&lt;/a&gt; doesn&amp;#8217;t mention which
sites have I2 peering. Luckily, the first logical one I tried - the
Harvard mirror - was showing an I2/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;MAGIPE&lt;/span&gt; route via&amp;nbsp;traceroute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If anyone else needs an I2 mirror of OpenSuSE,
&lt;a href="http://mirrors.med.harvard.edu/opensuse/"&gt;http://mirrors.med.harvard.edu/opensuse/&lt;/a&gt;
seems to do it. My desktop was getting a sustained +/- 160 Mbps transfer
rate, and I got the entire 4.&lt;span class="caps"&gt;3GB&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DVD&lt;/span&gt; image in under 2-1/2&amp;nbsp;minutes.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">admin</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 13 May 2009 13:36:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:blog.jasonantman.com,2009-05-13:2009/05/opensuse-internet2-mirror/</guid><category>internet2</category><category>opensuse</category></item><item><title>Brother HL2170W DHCP Problems</title><link>http://blog.jasonantman.com/2009/04/brother-hl2170w-dhcp-problems/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Two weeks ago, I &lt;a href="/2009/03/brother-hl-2170w-great-features-from-a-personal-laser-printer/"&gt;wrote about the Brother
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;HL&lt;/span&gt;-2170W&lt;/a&gt;
that I got for my mother. It seemed absolutely wonderful. Until the
night of March 31st, just before Conficker was supposed to strike. Being
that mom&amp;#8217;s computer is the only one at home running Windows, I finished
up a long-standing project - and moved her desktop, printer, and AppleTV
over to a separate &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VLAN&lt;/span&gt; that&amp;#8217;s not routable to anything else internal
(i.e. anything important, or anything of mine). I&amp;#8217;d already had the
&amp;#8220;client&amp;#8221; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VLAN&lt;/span&gt; setup for a while, so it was just a matter of tweaking the
firewall rules and moving the static &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DHCP&lt;/span&gt; assignments from one subnet to
the&amp;nbsp;other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, that&amp;#8217;s where the problems started. While her Windows &lt;span class="caps"&gt;XP&lt;/span&gt; desktop
and AppleTV coped nicely, and got their new addresses in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DHCP&lt;/span&gt; as they
should, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HL2170W&lt;/span&gt; did not, As a matter of fact, after two hours, I
hadn&amp;#8217;t seen a single &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DHCP&lt;/span&gt; request, even though I had the lease time set
to 10 minutes for both subnets. So, I tried administratively downing the
switch port a few times, to no avail. After a day of waiting, I came
back to the problem - and &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; found nothing in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DHCP&lt;/span&gt; logs from
that printer. I emailed mom and asked her to power-cycle it a few
times&amp;#8230; still nothing! It wasn&amp;#8217;t even requesting &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DHCP&lt;/span&gt; when rolled, let
alone at a regular&amp;nbsp;interval!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast forward a week or so, to today. I&amp;#8217;m ready to call Brother Support,
as my mother hasn&amp;#8217;t had use of her new printer in a week and a half. I&amp;#8217;m
infuriated - I&amp;#8217;ve rolled the printer dozens of times, and not a single
event in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DHCP&lt;/span&gt; log. I know it&amp;#8217;s sending traffic from the port - I&amp;#8217;ve
reset the counters and they&amp;#8217;re changing. I tried moving it back to the
original &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VLAN&lt;/span&gt; and confirmed that it still has its&amp;#8217; original &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IP&lt;/span&gt;. I could
get into the web interface via &lt;a href="http://lynx.isc.org/"&gt;lynx&lt;/a&gt; and *tell
it* to refresh &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DHCP&lt;/span&gt;, but this seemed quite pointless - there&amp;#8217;s no way
it&amp;#8217;s physically possible to send the web request and then switch the
port to the new &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VLAN&lt;/span&gt; before it gets&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DHCP&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I&amp;#8217;m ready to call Brother Support. I then notice that the printer is
turned off at the moment. From the switch log, it looks as though it&amp;#8217;s
been powered off for six days. So, I turn it on. And then go about
starting my prep for the Brother call, first opening up a tail on the
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DHCP&lt;/span&gt; server log, grepped for the proper interface. And, wouldn&amp;#8217;t you
know, as I get up to let the dog out, the printer starts spitting out&amp;nbsp;pages!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as I can tell, there&amp;#8217;s something &lt;em&gt;seriously wrong&lt;/em&gt; with the
Brother &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HL&lt;/span&gt;-2170W &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DHCP&lt;/span&gt; implementation. Specifically, it didn&amp;#8217;t get an
address on the new &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VLAN&lt;/span&gt; until it was powered off for a *long* time.
Even reboots wouldn&amp;#8217;t trigger a request, until the box had been powered
off for &lt;em&gt;days&lt;/em&gt;. More importantly, though, it seems that it only gets
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DHCP&lt;/span&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;once&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; when it boots, and totally disregards the lease&amp;nbsp;time!&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">admin</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 11 Apr 2009 11:53:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:blog.jasonantman.com,2009-04-11:2009/04/brother-hl2170w-dhcp-problems/</guid><category>dhcp</category><category>hl2170w</category><category>printer</category><category>vlan</category></item><item><title>New Idea for Updates</title><link>http://blog.jasonantman.com/2009/04/new-idea-for-updates/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s been a while since I&amp;#8217;ve posted any meaningful updates here.

with&amp;#8230; well&amp;#8230; whoever finds me on Google. I&amp;#8217;ve got some new code that
needs attention - lots of tiny little make-life-easier scripts and some
not-so-tiny stuff - as well as a few interesting things I&amp;#8217;ve found, and
some projects that deserve&amp;nbsp;updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, over the next week, I&amp;#8217;m going to try and make it my purpose to start
posting updates and shortening the list of things to mention. However,
I&amp;#8217;ve also decided to set aside a few minutes at the end of each day to
post whatever I did/found that&amp;#8217;s interesting, or add some updates on
ongoing projects. Perhaps also have a weekly writing hour (probably on
the weekend) to post larger&amp;nbsp;updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s also worth note that, for the most part, I never started a blog in
the hopes of having subscribers. I simply think of this as a place to
post some useful things that I do or figure out, in the hopes that other
people will stumble by and also find them&amp;nbsp;useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what have I been up to lately? Let&amp;#8217;s start with the past two&amp;nbsp;days:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trying to get &lt;a href="http://freeradius.org/"&gt;FreeRADIUS&lt;/a&gt; to authenticate
    with groupOfNames objects in &lt;a href="http://www.openldap.org/"&gt;OpenLDAP&lt;/a&gt;,
    the intended end result being centralized authentication for
    &lt;a href="http://m0n0.ch/wall/"&gt;m0n0wall&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8216;s captive&amp;nbsp;portal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At work, designing a system to test the client-visible functionality
    of a &lt;em&gt;large&lt;/em&gt; captive portal system (on the order of 700 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AP&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s and 50k
    users) - essentially, sitting on a client &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VLAN&lt;/span&gt; and checking &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DHCP&lt;/span&gt;,
    &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DNS&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTTP&lt;/span&gt; redirects, and the validity of the login&amp;nbsp;page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Security auditing of everything at home, and trying to find a
    working &lt;a href="http://www.nessus.org"&gt;Nessus&lt;/a&gt; web&amp;nbsp;interface.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continuing on my move over to static &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IP&lt;/span&gt; - specifically starting to
    roll out &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTTPS&lt;/span&gt; for some internal&amp;nbsp;stuff.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trying to get &lt;a href="http://www.vyatta.org"&gt;Vyatta&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8216;s &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VPN&lt;/span&gt; to work with a
    dynamically-IPed m0n0wall endpoint (in&amp;nbsp;network-to-network).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some cabling upgrades at home and at &lt;a href="http://www.midlandparkambulance.com"&gt;the ambulance
    corps&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Slowly but surely trying to make major changes and release a new
    version of &lt;a href="http://www.php-ems-tools.com"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EMS&lt;/span&gt; Tools&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get &lt;a href="http://www.bacula.org"&gt;Bacula&lt;/a&gt; working&amp;nbsp;better.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Load test this web server, and decide if it&amp;#8217;s time for new&amp;nbsp;hardware.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some new stuff for my&amp;nbsp;truck.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get rid of &lt;a href="http://www.mediawiki.org"&gt;MediaWiki&lt;/a&gt; as my
    &lt;a href="http://www.jasonantman.com"&gt;homepage&lt;/a&gt; and replace it with a&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CMS&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continue my move to SubVersion and setup ViewVC for&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rewrite my resume and start looking for jobs, as I&amp;#8217;m finishing
    classes in&amp;nbsp;July.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Try to get some sleep and keep my&amp;nbsp;sanity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">admin</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 04 Apr 2009 01:25:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:blog.jasonantman.com,2009-04-04:2009/04/new-idea-for-updates/</guid><category>updates</category></item><item><title>Brother HL-2170W - great features from a personal laser printer</title><link>http://blog.jasonantman.com/2009/03/brother-hl-2170w-great-features-from-a-personal-laser-printer/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve posted an &lt;a href="/2009/04/brother-hl2170w-dhcp-problems/"&gt;update about serious &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DHCP&lt;/span&gt; problems with this
unit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week my mother&amp;#8217;s printer died, and she asked me to find a new one
for her. After a quick look on &lt;a href="http://www.newegg.com"&gt;NewEgg&lt;/a&gt; (sort by
ratings is a wonderful thing) I found the &lt;a href="http://www.brother-usa.com/Printer/ModelDetail.aspx?ProductID=hl2170W"&gt;Brother
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;HL&lt;/span&gt;-2170W&lt;/a&gt;.
Aside from having a wireless interface (only a security hole, as far as
I&amp;#8217;m concerned) it seemed pretty cool - tiny B&amp;amp;W laser, Ethernet, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PCL6&lt;/span&gt;,
23ppm, 32 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MB&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RAM&lt;/span&gt;, 250 sheet capacity and 2400x600 dpi. So, for a mere
$99 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USD&lt;/span&gt;, I bought it for&amp;nbsp;her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the printer showed up, I was a bit let down to find no sticker
bearing the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MAC&lt;/span&gt; address on either the box or the printer itself - and
given the one-button hard control, there wasn&amp;#8217;t a way to manually print
a config sheet. So, after plugging it into the network and using the
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DHCP&lt;/span&gt; logs to give it a static assignment, a quick reboot of the printer
had everything working. As usual, I skipped to the last few pages in the
installation manual, and found the ½ page section on the web interface.
Configuration was pretty simple - change the admin password, disable a
bunch of unneeded services, etc. And then, when playing around with the
admin interface, I found a bit of a holy grail - there in the
enable/disable services screen were two options that I found unusual for
a &amp;#8220;personal&amp;#8221; printer; &lt;strong&gt;Telnet&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SNMP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. I immediately tried both.
An snmpwalk revealed the usual (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;RFC1213&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HOST&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;RESOURCES&lt;/span&gt;, and
Printer-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;MIB&lt;/span&gt;) including information on status and consumables. Though the
Telnet login process wasn&amp;#8217;t terribly intuitive, &amp;#8220;help&amp;#8221; revealed familiar
set/show/clear functionality as well as an option to zero out counters.
While I was a bit let down to see that there wasn&amp;#8217;t a way to view
consumable status or printer status, it did allow access to every
conceivable configuration parameter, including a few that weren&amp;#8217;t
mentioned on the web&amp;nbsp;interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, while I can&amp;#8217;t comment about reliability or quality yet, this
cute little printer seems to have quite a feature set, especially when
it comes to manageability and remote troubleshooting (a good thing for
any printer that&amp;#8217;s used by a family member who you support). And best of
all, it supports &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IPP&lt;/span&gt; and&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;LPR&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">admin</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 18 Mar 2009 21:29:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:blog.jasonantman.com,2009-03-18:2009/03/brother-hl-2170w-great-features-from-a-personal-laser-printer/</guid><category>printer</category><category>review</category></item><item><title>Lazy Spammers</title><link>http://blog.jasonantman.com/2009/03/lazy-spammers/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;This is by no means rare, but I happened to be checking through my spam
folder before deleting the contents (I used to just do this once a week
or so, but apparently since jasonantman.com is up and running correctly
and listening on port 25, the volume has increased a bit) and came by
this&amp;nbsp;email:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subject:
Dear $TO_EMAIL 17.3.2009 84% &lt;span class="caps"&gt;0FF&lt;/span&gt;
From: Best Price &amp;lt;$TO_EMAIL&amp;gt;

To:&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;$TO_EMAIL&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow. I know that spammers aren&amp;#8217;t exactly world-class programmers, but
this seems like something that anyone who&amp;#8217;s been in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CS101&lt;/span&gt; would realize
is&amp;nbsp;wrong&amp;#8230;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the positive side, maybe I should just add a SpamAssassin rule to
trigger for anything with &amp;#8220;$TO_EMAIL&amp;#8221; in the headers. Not that I&amp;#8217;d need
it in this case, as the message had a score of 21.7 and my threshold is&amp;nbsp;5.0&amp;#8230;.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">admin</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 18 Mar 2009 08:01:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:blog.jasonantman.com,2009-03-18:2009/03/lazy-spammers/</guid><category>lazy</category><category>spam</category></item><item><title>Online Exams and Reality</title><link>http://blog.jasonantman.com/2009/02/online-exams-and-reality/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;A friend recently showed me the syllabus for one of her classes, which
is partially given online through the &lt;a href="http://sakaiproject.org/portal"&gt;Sakai course management
system&lt;/a&gt;. At the bottom was a section on
course policies which stated, in part, that the &amp;#8220;Academic Integrity
policy is in full effect&amp;#8221;. Apparently, this professor is giving online
exams in Sakai. The policy goes on to state that not only is
collaborative test-taking not allowed, but also that use of any
resources (including a textbook) is not allowed. The policy states that
use of electronic resources (&amp;#8220;a second web browser&amp;#8221;) is also not
allowed, and that the course management system includes &amp;#8220;features&amp;#8221; to
prevent &amp;#8220;cheating&amp;#8221; - enumerated as a time stamp for every&amp;nbsp;answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To me at least, this shows not only an unrealistic outlook, but also a
horrible lack of understanding about&amp;nbsp;technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does this professor actually expect that he can have students taken
    an exam at home, on a computer, and none of them will Google an
    answer? If so, he should take some steps to actually prevent such
    actions - like having the students take the exam in a proctored
    environment. If not, what is the purpose of this&amp;nbsp;intimidation?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I know I&amp;#8217;m not a programming wizard, but if someone can tell me the
    algorithm to determine whether or not a student is cheating - &lt;em&gt;based
    solely on their answers and the submission time of each answer&lt;/em&gt; -
    I&amp;#8217;d really like to be&amp;nbsp;enlightened.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If professors want to administer exams online and prevent students from
using &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; outside resources, it seems to me like the only way to
realistically do this is to setup a human-proctored computer lab
(perhaps University-wide at a number of locations, available for members
of any class) that allows access only to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTTP&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTTPS&lt;/span&gt; for the course
management system and nothing else. All the human proctor would have to
do is sit in the room and make sure students aren&amp;#8217;t looking in textbooks
or conferring with each&amp;nbsp;other.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">admin</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2009 22:32:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>tag:blog.jasonantman.com,2009-02-17:2009/02/online-exams-and-reality/</guid><category>cms</category><category>course management</category><category>education</category></item><item><title>Why DRM is bad for consumers</title><link>http://blog.jasonantman.com/2009/02/why-drm-is-bad-for-consumers/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;While some people whom I greatly admire have &lt;a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/opposing-drm.html"&gt;stronger
feelings&lt;/a&gt; than I on the
subject, and many others, I felt the need to share some thoughts on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DRM&lt;/span&gt;
this&amp;nbsp;morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here at Rutgers, we had been promoting
&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruckus_Network"&gt;Ruckus&lt;/a&gt; for music
downloading. The idea was that if you go to Rutgers, you get to use
their service for free and download your music. I&amp;#8217;ve never used it. Even
if their software had &lt;em&gt;worked&lt;/em&gt; with Linux, it&amp;#8217;s still so badly &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DRM&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;ed
that I couldn&amp;#8217;t even burn the music to a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CD&lt;/span&gt;. Being an old-fashioned
person who has a regular old non-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;MP3&lt;/span&gt; cd player in my truck, what good
would that do&amp;nbsp;me?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, today Ruckus just shows&amp;nbsp;this:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Ruckus shutdown graphic" src="/GFX/ruckus_final.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ll admit it, I&amp;#8217;m not the least bit sad to see it go. And not just
because it was Windows-only at a time when Linux is gaining in
popularity and MacOS is all-out exploding. What was my real problem with
it? The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DRM&lt;/span&gt;. What good is a bunch of 1&amp;#8217;s and 0&amp;#8217;s if I can&amp;#8217;t use it the
way I like? You couldn&amp;#8217;t burn Ruckus music to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CD&lt;/span&gt;, and I doubt you could
use it on my ancient Sansa &lt;span class="caps"&gt;512MB&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MP3&lt;/span&gt; player either, as it doesn&amp;#8217;t
support &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DRM&lt;/span&gt; (and runs&amp;nbsp;Linux).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what&amp;#8217;s my final thought? From
&lt;a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/02/06/college-music-service-ruckus-shuts-down/"&gt;TechCrunch.com&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re told that music that has not passed its “renew date” still
works, but that music that has expired will no longer work because the
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DRM&lt;/span&gt; licensing server has apparently shut&amp;nbsp;down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DRM&lt;/span&gt; wasn&amp;#8217;t bad enough to begin with, the music you already have will
just &lt;strong&gt;stop working&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#8230; because the original distributor isn&amp;#8217;t there
anymore to tell it to&amp;nbsp;work.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">admin</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2009 09:06:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>tag:blog.jasonantman.com,2009-02-10:2009/02/why-drm-is-bad-for-consumers/</guid><category>drm</category><category>music</category><category>rutgers</category></item><item><title>My Birthday!</title><link>http://blog.jasonantman.com/2009/02/my-birthday/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I happened to be working with some timestamps today and noticed that

Console&lt;/a&gt;
post, since my truck was stolen and now recovered (with all of the
emergency equipment stripped out - weird) I&amp;#8217;ve got to start from
scratch. Since I finished the console, I&amp;#8217;ve started work on redoing the
lighting. The first grueling step was to check continuity of the
existing wiring (what was left of it), strip out everything that didn&amp;#8217;t
work, and rehab what did. Then I did a few pulls, mainly a giant pull
from the console to under the hood of six 16-ga wires and three 12-ga,
along with a massive run of 6-ga welding cable direct from the battery
(with a circuit breaker) to the&amp;nbsp;console.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#8217;s a thread covering this install over at
&lt;a href="http://www.elightbars.org/bb/post59822.html"&gt;elightbars.org&lt;/a&gt; as well as
a thread on the &lt;a href="http://www.elightbars.org/bb/post24858.html"&gt;previous (original)
installation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is part 1 of (hopefully only) 2. The list of what&amp;#8217;s installed so
far&amp;nbsp;is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Custom&amp;nbsp;console.&lt;/li&gt;

    switch box - 3-position slider, 5 on/off rocker switches and one
    on-off-(on) rocker&amp;nbsp;switch.&lt;/li&gt;

    F5061&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

on &lt;a href="http://www.elightbars.org"&gt;eLightbars.org&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.elightbars.org/bb//topic401009.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href="http://www.elightbars.org/bb/post59822.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). My 2006 Ford F-250
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CC&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;XLT&lt;/span&gt; was stolen in September, 2008. It was recovered about a month
later, after Geico said they&amp;#8217;d pay out, and after I&amp;#8217;d bought another
vehicle. Anyway, it came back from the body shop about 2 months later,
and it was time to begin customizing it again. The main parts of the
project were wiring and installation and building a custom&amp;nbsp;console&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My main inspiration was some of the custom consoles done by places like
&lt;a href="http://www.odysseyauto.com/"&gt;Odyssey&lt;/a&gt;, though I wanted something
carpeted (hopefully a close match to the factory interior). The main
idea I was working off of was this one from&amp;nbsp;Odyssey:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Odyssey Excursion
console" src="http://www.odysseyauto.com/cabinets/Images/cabpics/excurcon-lg.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The general idea was to have a replacement for the factory console which
would allow mounting of a radio, emergency lighting controls, and a few
other things while not sacrificing storage space. The specific
requirements that I came up with&amp;nbsp;included:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mount over the transmission hump more or less where the factory
    console is, forward to the&amp;nbsp;dash.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allow access to the pull-out cupholders in the dash and not impede
    access to any&amp;nbsp;controls.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fasten to the floor using only the four factory console&amp;nbsp;bolts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allow mounting of at least one radio, one switch box, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPS&lt;/span&gt; and&amp;nbsp;scanner.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Radio and switch box should be mounted using the &lt;a href="http://www.jottodesk.com/"&gt;Jotto
    Desk&lt;/a&gt; faceplates that I had from the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CVPI&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;console.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;The real clincher that prevented me from using a stock console:&lt;/em&gt; Have a large storage
    compartment comparable to the factory&amp;nbsp;console.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provide a set of rear&amp;nbsp;cupholders.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent some time over the course of three days or so measuring the
console area of the truck and drawing out my initial plan in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CAD&lt;/span&gt;
(specifically the demo version of &lt;a href="http://www.qcad.org/qcad.html"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;QCAD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
for Linux - regrettably not Free software). Once I had the plans drawn
up and was satisfied that the angles and measurements were within
acceptable tolerance, I made a full-scale prototype out of foam core
board. With a little shaving of the corners, I managed to get a
relatively good form and transferred it to ½&amp;#8221; cabinet-grade luan
plywood. It was a bit difficult with only a jigsaw, but worked out
relatively well. While I can&amp;#8217;t seem to find any pictures of the foam
core, here are some of the wood form being assembled and the test fit in
the&amp;nbsp;truck:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="first assembly and test of console" src="/GFX/TruckConsole/console2-small.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="first assembly and test of console" src="/GFX/TruckConsole/console1-small.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="first assembly and test of console" src="/GFX/TruckConsole/console3-small.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;d originally been a bit worried about the structural integrity, but I
found that by clamping the corners, pre-drilling and securing them with
aggressive wood screws at approximately 1 screw per 1.5 inches along the
joints, the plywood held together&amp;nbsp;fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After testing the fit and checking that the four factory bolt holes
lined up correctly (which they did, and also held the console quite
securely), I pulled it back out and started the process of carpeting it.
I bought 2 yards (76 x 72 inch) of color #8078 &amp;#8220;Dark Grey/Quartz&amp;#8221; plush
cut pile automotive carpet from
&lt;a href="http://www.stockinteriors.com/"&gt;StockInteriors.com&lt;/a&gt;, for about $80 with
shipping. It turns out that the color isn&amp;#8217;t an exact match to the
factory carpet (I got 6 sample squares from them and this was the
closest color) but it&amp;#8217;s a good medium between the carpet and&amp;nbsp;upholstery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Planning for how to cover this wooden behemoth with carpet took quite a
few hours, and short of making it into a week-long job of sewing, I
decided to wrap the sides and back with one piece, folded over on the
bottom and top edges of the storage box, then use separate pieces for
the top of the console and the front (which would be adjacent to the
dash and mostly hidden from view). I started off with a plan to use &lt;a href="http://solutions.3m.com/wps/portal/3M/en_US/3M-Super-77/Super77/SprayAdhesive/"&gt;3M
Super
90&lt;/a&gt;
spray adhesive, on the advice of an &lt;a href="http://www.elightbars.org"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ELB&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
member. Unfortunately, I could only find &lt;a href="http://solutions.3m.com/wps/portal/3M/en_US/3M-Super-77/Super77/SprayAdhesive/"&gt;Super
77&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior to carpeting, I had to get the equipment mounting openings down to
about 8.5&amp;#8221; for the 8.75&amp;#8221; Jotto faceplates. I cut some excess luan
plywood down into 2&amp;#8221; wide strips and then cut them to length for the
openings, sandwiching about three together with &lt;a href="http://www.liquidnails.com/products/product.jsp?productId=42"&gt;Liquid
Nails&lt;/a&gt; and
then mounted them vertically on the sides of the&amp;nbsp;console.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carpeting the console at 2 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AM&lt;/span&gt; probably wasn&amp;#8217;t the best idea. I looked at
how the cut edges of the carpet would meet and the corners, and decided
I&amp;#8217;d need some sort of edge molding to make it look good - preferably
black powder coated aluminum, somewhere around ½&amp;#8221; legs. As such, I
decided to forgo most of the glue and stapled the carpet at the edges,
planning to cover it with molding. Ok, I lose a few points for that one.
The last thing to go on was the carpet on the front and top, which I
glued with Super 77 and also stapled on the front (where it can&amp;#8217;t be
seen). I cut X-shapes in the mounting areas and folded the carpet down,
stapling it to the inside of the console, and cut a slit in the front
for wiring. The glue didn&amp;#8217;t seem to hold on the narrow parts of the
top/mounting area, but once faceplates were screwed in it was fine. The
faceplates are just held in with screws into the vertical wood strips
placed on the sides of the&amp;nbsp;opening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Top view of the console, mounted in place, with the unfinished storage&amp;nbsp;box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="top view of console" src="/GFX/TruckConsole/DSC_0040_small.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="view from drivers seat" src="/GFX/TruckConsole/DSC_0042_small.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Factory cupholders extended with just enough clearance to&amp;nbsp;work:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="factory cupholders open, barely" src="/GFX/TruckConsole/DSC_0045_small.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Staples around the edges, intended to be covered with molding. They&amp;#8217;re
really not that visible unless you make a point of looking at them
(given their placement). Red handle is a 100A cutoff for the main
battery lead, with a removable&amp;nbsp;handle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="staples around edges and battery cutoff switch" src="/GFX/TruckConsole/DSC_0046_small.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The weekend after console fabrication, I started wiring. Here&amp;#8217;s the
relevant parts involving the&amp;nbsp;console.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Semi-finished console with equipment mounted. Front-to back,
&lt;a href="http://www.ram-mount.com/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;RAM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; magnet mount for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPS&lt;/span&gt;, Radio Shack
&lt;a href="http://wiki.radioreference.com/index.php/Pro-433"&gt;Pro-433&lt;/a&gt;, Galls
&lt;a href="http://www.galls.com/style.html?assort=general_catalog&amp;amp;style=SE082"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SE082&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,
nifty Jotto storage&amp;nbsp;tray.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="equipment in mounted

&lt;p&gt;Wire routing in loom from the console to under the dash
&lt;img alt="main wiring

75014&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;img alt="rear of

&lt;p&gt;Still to be&amp;nbsp;done:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most of the wiring and&amp;nbsp;installation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lining the storage box with something, probably toolbox drawer&amp;nbsp;liner.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Making a cover/lid for the storage&amp;nbsp;box.&lt;/li&gt;

700p&lt;/a&gt; to record
phone calls. About a month or two ago, I had some issues with my phone
and had to call Verizon Wireless. The poor woman was trying to open a
ticket for me, but said that she was having some problems, as they were
moving from one ticketing system to another, she was having some issues
with the new one, and the old one was down at her&amp;nbsp;location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As she waited for a rep from another location to come on the line and
enter the ticket, I happened to remark that I work in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IT&lt;/span&gt; and had been
doing some work with them (&lt;a href="http://eventum.mysql.com"&gt;Eventum&lt;/a&gt;) lately.
She mentioned that the old one was a proprietary system, but asked if
I&amp;#8217;d ever heard of &lt;a href="http://www.mantisbt.org/"&gt;Mantis&lt;/a&gt;. Of course, I said
that I had. And was then asked if I knew much about it, and whether I
might know what the problem she was having was caused by. Unfortunately,
I had to say no, as I&amp;#8217;d never used it for more than a few minutes. But I
did get to confirm that a company as large and closed (they won&amp;#8217;t
support Linux, their phones run closed &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OS&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s, and they block my port 80)
as Verizon is happily transitioning from closed-source proprietary
software to a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPL&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;d alternative. I also got another item to add to my
list of telephone tech support people who have asked me (the customer)
for&amp;nbsp;support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I don&amp;#8217;t see Verizon listed on the list of &lt;a href="http://www.mantisbt.org/directory.php"&gt;known Mantis
users&lt;/a&gt;, so I have no way to fully
confirm&amp;nbsp;this.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">admin</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 17 Dec 2008 16:44:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>tag:blog.jasonantman.com,2008-12-17:2008/12/verizon-wireless-uses-mantis-for-ticketing/</guid><category>mantis</category><category>ticketing</category><category>verizon</category></item><item><title>Priorities</title><link>http://blog.jasonantman.com/2008/11/priorities/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Why is it that Rutgers cancels classes &lt;em&gt;hours&lt;/em&gt; before a football game,

I don&amp;#8217;t know how many times I&amp;#8217;ve
struggled with web apps that I wrote for the &lt;a href="http://www.midlandparkambulance.com"&gt;ambulance
corps&lt;/a&gt; to try and get printed
output correct. I&amp;#8217;ve done everything from generating PDFs, doing screen
captures of a browser and printing as a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PDF&lt;/span&gt;, to things as crazy as
trying to print schedules directly from the server, where they&amp;#8217;re setup
as&amp;nbsp;postscript.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just happened to be going through my news in &lt;a href="http://reader.google.com"&gt;Google
Reader&lt;/a&gt; and found some interesting &lt;span class="caps"&gt;W3C&lt;/span&gt; draft
standards for &lt;a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css-print/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CSS&lt;/span&gt; Print Profiles&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-page/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CSS3&lt;/span&gt; Paged Media Module&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Finally&lt;/em&gt;,
after waiting for literally years, there will (from the way it looks) be
a way for me to specify, in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CSS&lt;/span&gt;, the page size - and more importantly,
orientation - and have something print&amp;nbsp;correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the end of me having to manually print ambulance corps rosters,
and then set the print settings back to landscape and 73% scaling for
the schedule, are finally going to be&amp;nbsp;over!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C&amp;#8217;mon, Mozilla, I&amp;#8217;m counting on a quick implementation once they&amp;#8217;re&amp;nbsp;finalized.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">admin</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 27 Oct 2008 17:55:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:blog.jasonantman.com,2008-10-27:2008/10/finally-css-for-printing/</guid><category>css</category><category>printing</category><category>standards</category><category>w3c</category></item><item><title>Interesting Links for 2008-10-22</title><link>http://blog.jasonantman.com/2008/10/interesting-links-for-2008-10-22/</link><description>&lt;ul&gt;

which speaks about the myriad different distributions used on NetBooks
(like the &lt;a href="http://eee.asus.com"&gt;eeePC&lt;/a&gt; and its&amp;#8217; brethren), many of which
are significantly different from the usual mainstream&amp;nbsp;distros.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My&amp;nbsp;comment:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a vendor&amp;#8217;s point of view, it probably seems a good idea. However,
there are two major problems that I see in it. Firstly, while there
aren&amp;#8217;t a gigantic number of people that can give aid with Linux, there
are quite a few - especially in one of the hottest areas (that I&amp;#8217;ve
seen) for the eeePC, colleges and universities. Unless the vendor is
prepared to offer high-quality &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OS&lt;/span&gt; and application tech support, they
should do all they can to make use of whatever Linux support resources
already exist. Ubuntu is becoming increasingly common, so the best move
(in my mind) would be to re-brand Ubuntu, but keep the functionality the
same, therefore making use of (arguably) a relatively large experience
base, by Linux standards. If you&amp;#8217;re a hardware company, and don&amp;#8217;t focus
on providing (software) technical support, the smartest thing to do is
to try and maximize the amount of third-party software support that&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, and perhaps more importantly, we&amp;#8217;ve finally started to reach a
time when Linux is becoming standardized. Most popular distros follow
(more-or-less) the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LSB&lt;/span&gt; specification, and Gnome and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;KDE&lt;/span&gt; have become the
accepted standards for pretty much all non-geek graphical environments.
It&amp;#8217;s taken years to reach this point, and the introduction of
mass-market netbooks, many with their own customized distros, is not
helping, nor is it smart on the manufacturers&amp;#8217;&amp;nbsp;part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the biggest problem is that the manufacturers themselves just
see Linux as an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OS&lt;/span&gt; that doesn&amp;#8217;t cost them anything, without seeing the
big picture. If they truly understood Free software, they&amp;#8217;d be working
to improve on existing technology, while retaining the existing code as
a base, rather than struggling to differentiate their offering. If I was
to start selling Linux-based netbooks, I think the solution is quite
simple, just by following the trends in the Linux world: sell a
&amp;#8220;business&amp;#8221; version that runs RedHat or CentOS, maybe SuSE, and a
&amp;#8220;consumer&amp;#8221; version that has Ubuntu (which, as far as I&amp;#8217;ve seen, is the
most popular with the non-linux crowd). Rather than trying to build my
own distro and differentiate it from everything else, I&amp;#8217;d build on what
little Linux experience the general public has, by using the most common
distros. If the marketing guys want differentiation so badly, that&amp;#8217;s the
wonder of Free software - just add vendor-specific logos and a custom&amp;nbsp;theme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a personal note, I&amp;#8217;ve had an eeePC 701G Surf since December 2007. The
*first* thing I did when I got it was create a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;4GB&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SDHC&lt;/span&gt; card with a
full install of my favorite distro, and set it up to boot from the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SDHC&lt;/span&gt;.
I haven&amp;#8217;t booted Xandros more than twice. Even the &amp;#8220;expert&amp;#8221; mode, which
is somewhat like a normal desktop environment, is severely lacking in
common tools, administrative tools, and security (the user separation is
abysmal). I would&amp;#8217;ve been much more happy to see it ship with a good
install of Ubuntu, even locked down with a &amp;#8220;simple&amp;#8221; desktop for the
default user. Things like sed, awk, grep, and an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SSH&lt;/span&gt; server should be
instaled on every Linux system. Also, just a theory - set each system to
have a unique, randomly generated root password, and print it on a label
on the bottom of the&amp;nbsp;machine.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">admin</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 19 Sep 2008 13:28:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:blog.jasonantman.com,2008-09-19:2008/09/linuxjournal-netbooks/</guid></item><item><title>Interesting Links for 2008-09-18</title><link>http://blog.jasonantman.com/2008/09/interesting-links-for-2008-09-18/</link><description>&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t know if I&amp;#8217;m the only one experiencing this, but this is the
third time in two days that I&amp;#8217;ve gotten a 503 when trying to view my
bookmarks on &lt;a href="http://del.icio.us"&gt;del.icio.us&lt;/a&gt;. This is posing a
problem, as I use the service to keep my bookmarks in sync between five&amp;nbsp;computers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of the time of this post, I&amp;#8217;m able to get to the site again, but I
was unable to get there - or update my bookmarks on my main workstation
at work - for about ten&amp;nbsp;minutes.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">admin</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 15 Sep 2008 12:47:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:blog.jasonantman.com,2008-09-15:2008/09/delicious-problems-503/</guid><category>bookmarks</category><category>del.icio.us</category></item><item><title>Going away for a while</title><link>http://blog.jasonantman.com/2008/09/going-away-for-a-while/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, my truck was stolen this past Friday while at work. I
probably won&amp;#8217;t be posting much in the neat future, as I&amp;#8217;m going to be
quite busy trying to get things back together (insurance, etc.) while
also working and taking&amp;nbsp;classes.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">admin</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 14 Sep 2008 16:58:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:blog.jasonantman.com,2008-09-14:2008/09/going-away-for-a-while/</guid></item><item><title>eeePC stronger than ever</title><link>http://blog.jasonantman.com/2008/09/eeepc-stronger-than-ever/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;It seems like every time I open up my &lt;a href="http://reader.google.com"&gt;Google
Reader&lt;/a&gt; account, there&amp;#8217;s news about another
company that released a knock-off of my beloved &lt;a href="http://eeepc.asus.com/global/700.htm"&gt;Asus eeePC 4G Surf
(701)&lt;/a&gt; (interestingly, it looks
like eeepc.asus.com is down at the moment of writing). Even Asus has
released numerous (I think the product like is now up to about 10
variations) follow-ups to the 7&amp;#8221; beauty, now up to 10&amp;#8221; in size (though,
admittedly, I&amp;#8217;m less-than-enthused about their Windows&amp;nbsp;models).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the new semester here, I am (unfortunately) back in class. And I&amp;#8217;m
very happy to report that I&amp;#8217;m starting to see eeePCs in more and more
hands. Granted, my classes are in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IT&lt;/span&gt; program, but I was quite
surprised last night to be sitting in my Internet Security class and
notice no less than four eeePCs in a class of about 25 people. While
I&amp;#8217;ve just relegated my own 4G to my server room bag, replacing it with a
(used, surplus from work) &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IBM&lt;/span&gt; ThinkPad T41 (14.1&amp;#8221; display, 1.4GHz
Pentium, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;768MB&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RAM&lt;/span&gt;, and a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DVD&lt;/span&gt; drive). Though my heart sank when I found
that half of the eeePCs were running Windows, it seems that in my
travels around campus, I&amp;#8217;m seeing more and more eeePCs, and more laptops
running&amp;nbsp;Linux.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the academic world has surely embraced new technologies, and
non-mainstream technologies, quicker than other sectors (specifically
considering Linux and the apparent popularity of the eeePC), it&amp;#8217;s
definitely a good omen. Seeing non-geek, and perhaps even non-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CS&lt;/span&gt; and
non-Engineering, students using Linux speaks quite well for the
expansion of the Linux user base when these students graduate and enter
the &amp;#8220;real&amp;nbsp;world&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">admin</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 10 Sep 2008 23:55:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:blog.jasonantman.com,2008-09-10:2008/09/eeepc-stronger-than-ever/</guid><category>asus</category><category>eeepc</category><category>linux</category></item><item><title>Linux, Choice, Updates, CitiBank issues</title><link>http://blog.jasonantman.com/2008/08/linux-choice-updates-citibank-issues/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update July 11, 2011&lt;/strong&gt; - I &lt;a href="/2011/07/article-on-theinquirer-net/"&gt;just found
out&lt;/a&gt; that this post is heavily
quote in &lt;a href="http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/1026958/citibank-infuriating-customers-linux-hostile-site"&gt;an article on
theinquirer.net&lt;/a&gt;
about this issue. Luckily (I don&amp;#8217;t know whether I made a difference or
not, certainly CitiBank never contacted me back), citicards.com now
works with Firefox on Linux. I have no idea if it was a change made by
Citi, or a change with Firefox or Flash&amp;nbsp;Player.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know this blog has been less-than-active lately. Life has been pretty
busy, between a massive network upgrade at the &lt;a href="http://www.midlandparkambulance.com"&gt;ambulance
corps&lt;/a&gt; that I volunteer with, the
impending doom of a new semester at work, scheduling courses, and a few
personal projects. I do, however, have a long list of things to post,
including some notes on my upgrade to &lt;a href="http://www.nagios.org"&gt;Nagios 3&lt;/a&gt;,
my recent experience with the &lt;a href="http://www.pcengines.ch/alix.htm"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PC&lt;/span&gt; Engines
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ALIX&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; board, some changes to
&lt;a href="http://tuxostat.jasonantman.com"&gt;tuxOstat&lt;/a&gt;, and my plans to upgrade to
Optimum Business cable with 5 static IPs - finally a real home for
&lt;a href="http://www.jasonantman.com"&gt;JasonAntman.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CitiCards Problems -&lt;/strong&gt; I had a somewhat unnerving experience this
morning. Having just gotten a Citibank credit card, and made my first
few purchases on it, I browsed to
&lt;a href="https://www.citicards.com"&gt;CitiCards.com&lt;/a&gt; to check my account summary.
I happened to be using a just-purchased &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IBM&lt;/span&gt; T41 laptop, running
&lt;a href="http://www.opensuse.org"&gt;OpenSuSE 11.0&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href="http://www.getfirefox.com"&gt;FireFox3&lt;/a&gt;, so when I saw the page display
and then go completely blank, I suspected a problem with my Flash
plugin. Little did I know, but I tried the same page on 3 other
Linux/Firefox machines, with the same result. I put in a call to the
tech support line, and was gruffly informed by the representative that
Firefox was not supported, they were unable to support it, and, to
paraphrase, I should get another browser or f*** off. She was &lt;em&gt;very
well-aware&lt;/em&gt; of the issue, and stated that Citi would not fix it. At this
point, I stated that I thought I would cancel my card, and she told me
to have a nice day and hung&amp;nbsp;up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to go to step 2 of the Generic Problem Solving
Method,
and found &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;amp;q=citicards.com+linux&amp;amp;btnG=Google+Search"&gt;hundreds of references to a problem with CitiCards.com on
Linux&lt;/a&gt;.
I read through a lot of conspiracy theory, but decided to test one of
the theories (and fixes). Sure enough, when I right-clicked on the blank
white screen, I got a Flash context menu. Clicking &amp;#8220;Play&amp;#8221; showed the ad,
and I was able to click the little &amp;#8220;X&amp;#8221; in the top right and bypass it,
gaining access to the normal main page. Never to be one to ignore a
conspiracy (or anti-Linux) theory, I pulled up the same page on a Mac.
Sure enough, that particular ad (set not to play and with an opaque
full-screen background) didn&amp;#8217;t show up. Hmm&amp;#8230; maybe there&amp;#8217;s something
to the theory put forth by the &lt;a href="http://stealcode.blogspot.com/2008/07/citibank-doesnt-like-linuxubuntu_27.html"&gt;guy who said CitiBank is blocking Linux
users&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to call back, and this time spoke with Susan at CitiCards tech
support. She was very understanding, and apologized for both the
inconvenience and the previous representative&amp;#8217;s attitude. She said that
she was aware of some issues with Firefox and Linux, but stated that
they are only unsupported so far as Tech Support won&amp;#8217;t walk a customer
using Linux or FireFox through any issue resolution, but that both the
browser and architecture should, theoretically, work. She didn&amp;#8217;t know
anything about a policy against Linux, or intentional blocking/sabotage.
She did say, however, that they are &amp;#8220;working on it&amp;#8221;. I did inform her
that the problem could probably be resolved by simply editing the Flash
ad to be properly transparent, or suppressing it for Linux
architectures, though I doubt that the information will make its&amp;#8217; way up
the food chain. Unfortunately, I can&amp;#8217;t seem to find a contact email for
anything site-related on&amp;nbsp;CitiCards.com.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this is really a case of intentional blocking, it would be quite
infuriating - I filled out the application for the card on
FireFox3/Linux&amp;#8230; but then they block account&amp;nbsp;access?&lt;/p&gt;

thought I&amp;#8217;d learn much in such a course at
&lt;a href="http://scils.rutgers.edu"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SCILS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but I&amp;#8217;d like to graduate on time, and
need the credits, and Bill Crosbie is just the type of rare teacher that
can keep even me awake and interested. Our book is &lt;a href="http://www.informit.com/store/product.aspx?isbn=0132239973"&gt;Practical &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt; and
MySQL: Building Eight Dynamic Web
Applications&lt;/a&gt;
(&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Practical-PHP-MySQL-Building-Applications/dp/0132239973"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;)
by &lt;a href="http://www.jonobacon.org/"&gt;Jono Bacon&lt;/a&gt;. Now, I know it&amp;#8217;s not a
&lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; book like, say, &lt;a href="http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596003432/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ESA3&lt;/span&gt; by
Frisch&lt;/a&gt;, which has a healthy
&lt;a href="http://www.aeleen.com/home.htm"&gt;web presense&lt;/a&gt;. But this thing is all
code and doesn&amp;#8217;t even have a web site, let alone easy code&amp;nbsp;downloads!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book does come with a heavily customized Ubuntu LiveCD. However,
when I popped it in my &lt;a href="http://www.opensuse.org"&gt;OpenSuSE workstation&lt;/a&gt;,
I couldn&amp;#8217;t really make much out of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CD&lt;/span&gt; - there was certainly no
easy-to-find &amp;#8220;this is the code&amp;#8221; directory. Well, after some exploring, I
mounted the &lt;a href="http://squashfs.sourceforge.net/"&gt;SquashFS&lt;/a&gt; filesystem and
poked around a bit. Strange&amp;#8230; seems to only have one real user (root)
and, though they claim this is a fully-functional &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LAMP&lt;/span&gt; server, no Apache
or MySQL. Really weird. Well, after poking for a few minutes, I found
the holy grail - &lt;code&gt;/root/.bash_history&lt;/code&gt; was intact! Just a quick look
through it with &lt;code&gt;less&lt;/code&gt; and I found what I was looking for: &lt;code&gt;/opt/lampp&lt;/code&gt;.
It appears that the install is actually ApacheFriends&amp;#8217;
&lt;a href="http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp-linux.html"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;LAMPP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;span class="caps"&gt;XAMPP&lt;/span&gt; for
Linux (gotta wonder if the guy writing this book doesn&amp;#8217;t even know how
to install Apache&amp;#8230; I&amp;#8217;m sure &lt;span class="caps"&gt;XAMPP&lt;/span&gt; for Linux is more bloated than a
customized build of Apache/MySQL/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt; from source, especially since it&amp;#8217;s
only being used to host 8 sample projects, so a lot could be left&amp;nbsp;out).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, it appears that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LAMPP&lt;/span&gt; is running in a chroot&amp;#8217;ed environment. The
actual sample code is rooted at &lt;code&gt;/opt/lampp/htdocs/sites&lt;/code&gt;. It seems that
&lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt; files are also owned by root and chmod&amp;#8217;ed 777! And
the top-level &lt;code&gt;index.php&lt;/code&gt; file makes use of absolute links, so obviously
he never thought that someone may want to copy the sample code and use
it on a &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just can&amp;#8217;t imagine someone who&amp;#8217;s a beginner with Linux, let alone a
Windows person, trying to get this source code onto a machine where they
can actually play with it. And&amp;#8230; to make the situation worse&amp;#8230; the
LiveCD has vi and vim, but no Emacs!!!!&amp;nbsp;Eeeek!!&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">admin</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 26 Jun 2008 14:29:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:blog.jasonantman.com,2008-06-26:2008/06/practical-php-and-mysql/</guid><category>books</category><category>linux</category><category>PHP</category><category>programming</category><category>rutgers</category></item><item><title>Interesting Links for 2008-06-20</title><link>http://blog.jasonantman.com/2008/06/interesting-links-for-2008-06-20/</link><description>&lt;ul&gt;

And it&amp;#8217;s wonderful. I&amp;#8217;ve had it running all
day, and absolutely love it. I just got &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FFX&lt;/span&gt; 3 running on my laptop (my
primary workstation). The memory management does appear to be better -
nowhere near as much of a strain on the laptop (a mere &lt;span class="caps"&gt;1GB&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RAM&lt;/span&gt;), and
better page load time. I&amp;#8217;m not sure how I feel about the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UI&lt;/span&gt; changes, but
those can be dealt&amp;nbsp;with&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For everyone who downloaded Firefox 3 today - good job! Over
&lt;strong&gt;8 Million&lt;/strong&gt; downloads in 24 hours,
and inching up to 580 Million total downloads of&amp;nbsp;Firefox!!!&lt;/p&gt;

And if you haven&amp;#8217;t taken a swing by the &lt;a href="http://www.spreadfirefox.com/en-US/worldrecord"&gt;Firefox
Download Site&lt;/a&gt; yet
today, shame on you! Mozilla is attempting to get the Guinness World
Record for most software downloads in 24 hours - and that 24 hours ends
at 2:16 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PM&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EDT&lt;/span&gt; today! So run over and get it&amp;#8230; now! (and please
download from Mozilla&amp;#8217;s site so they have an accurate&amp;nbsp;count).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I&amp;#8217;m going to do my part by downloading the Linux tarball on
every machine I have that has a graphical display - though I don&amp;#8217;t know
if my &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NAT&lt;/span&gt; will end up being counted as one download. For the Linux users
out there, I was able to find an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RPM&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/mozilla:/beta/openSUSE_10.3/i586/"&gt;on the openSuSE
site&lt;/a&gt;
though I&amp;#8217;m not yet sure whether it&amp;#8217;s the release or the beta version.
Windows and Mac users have it easier - Mozilla packages software for
you, we have to do it ourselves or wait for someone else&amp;nbsp;to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, Firefox 3 is supposed to have much better memory usage, be a bit
faster, and also have some great &lt;a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/features/"&gt;feature
enhancements&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">admin</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 18 Jun 2008 08:35:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:blog.jasonantman.com,2008-06-18:2008/06/firefox-3-finally-out/</guid></item><item><title>Update</title><link>http://blog.jasonantman.com/2008/06/update-2/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve been incredibly busy lately. But I have 2 quick&amp;nbsp;updates-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;tuxOstat, my thermostat project, isn&amp;#8217;t totally finished, but is up
and running. There&amp;#8217;s still some work to do, but the code is largely
complete. There&amp;#8217;s
also a web interface with temperature
graphs, system status, and a (horrible) webcam view of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LCD&lt;/span&gt; control
panel. I&amp;#8217;ll probably be finishing up a first version this week,
finishing the documentation next week, and releasing what I have&amp;nbsp;soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got an e-mail today about one of my older projects, &lt;a href="http://www.php-ems-tools.com"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EMS&lt;/span&gt;
Tools&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt;/MySQL based application for
fire/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;EMS&lt;/span&gt; agencies to handle scheduling, membership rosters, equipment
checks, etc. The potential user was asking about running the software on
Windows - which, of course, I have no experience with. I&amp;#8217;m pretty sure
there aren&amp;#8217;t many, if any, Unix-specific calls hidden in the code, and
advised him to try &lt;span class="caps"&gt;XAMPP&lt;/span&gt; (Apache/MySQL on Windows). But I did take a
moment to comment on why I chose Linux. My pilot installation of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EMS&lt;/span&gt;
Tools, at the Midland Park Volunteer Ambulance Corps, where I&amp;#8217;ve been a
member since 2005, has been handling our scheduling, roster, and
equipment checks since June 2006. It&amp;#8217;s running on a generation 1 Compaq
Proliant &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DL380&lt;/span&gt;, running dual Pentium &lt;span class="caps"&gt;III&lt;/span&gt; 733MHz processors and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;1GB&lt;/span&gt;
memory - and even with a number of other programs on it, including
ieilogd which is reading from the
serial port 24x7 - the load average has never passed 1.2 and the memory
usage is well under 50%. More importantly, the system has been up for
442 days without a&amp;nbsp;hiccup!&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">admin</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 15 Jun 2008 11:03:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>tag:blog.jasonantman.com,2008-06-15:2008/06/update-2/</guid><category>ieilogd</category><category>linux</category><category>php ems tools</category><category>tuxostat</category></item><item><title>Interesting Links for 2008-05-28</title><link>http://blog.jasonantman.com/2008/05/interesting-links-for-2008-05-28/</link><description>&lt;ul&gt;

It was a bit of a pain, but
it&amp;nbsp;worked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Uninstall &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ALL&lt;/span&gt; of java, jdk, netbeans, and remove user&amp;#8217;s SunSPOT&amp;nbsp;directory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Totally remove /usr/java /usr/lib/ /usr/lib/java-1.4.0
    /usr/lib/java-1.4.1 /usr/lib/java-1.4.2 /usr/lib/java-1.5.0
    /usr/lib/java-ext /usr/lib/jvm /usr/lib/jvm-exports&amp;nbsp;/usr/lib/jvm-private&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Totally remove your&amp;nbsp;.netbeans&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install the&amp;nbsp;jdk6&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install&amp;nbsp;netbeans6.1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Login as your normal user, run Netbeans. Install the SunSPOT plugins
    from Bruno Ghisi&amp;#8217;s blog -&amp;nbsp;http://weblogs.java.net/blog/brunogh/archive/2008/04/starting_with_s.html&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install&amp;nbsp;ant&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Symlink /usr/local/netbeans to&amp;nbsp;/usr/local/netbeans-6.1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Here, ant -version failed for me. I had to run ant &amp;#8212;execdebug many
    many times and do a *lot* of&amp;nbsp;symlinking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install SunSPOT sdk through&amp;nbsp;SPOTManager.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To install demos, under &amp;#8220;Preferences&amp;#8221; select &amp;#8220;Beta Update Center&amp;#8221;,
    change Network Timeout, go back to SDKs and install Purple&amp;nbsp;demos.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cd into \~/SunSPOT/sdk, ln -s ../Demos&amp;nbsp;Demos&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go back to NetBeans (exit SPOTManager) and open the&amp;nbsp;TelemetryDemo-onSpot.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now it&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;WORKS&lt;/span&gt;!&lt;/li&gt;
