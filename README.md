Jason Antman's Blog
===================

[![Project Status: Active - The project has reached a stable, usable state and is being actively developed.](http://www.repostatus.org/badges/0.1.0/active.svg)](http://www.repostatus.org/#active)

This is the repository that backs my [Pelican](http://getpelican.com)-powered
static blog. It's here for anyone to take a peek at. The actual blog isn't
online yet - this is still a work in progress.

I should have some information on migrating from WordPress to Pelican here
shortly.
