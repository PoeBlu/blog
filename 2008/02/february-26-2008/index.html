                <p>Well, while I haven&#8217;t made much progress on anything interesting -
mainly my <span class="caps">NMS</span> comparison or any of my other projects - due to my busy
schedule, I did get an hour or two to clean up my network at the
apartment, swapping out my 24-port Linksys switch in my room for the
5-port Netgear previously used for printing. I threw all of the printers
and the print server on their own <span class="caps">VLAN</span> on the main 3com&nbsp;switch.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve also started thinking more about [MythTV][] - I use it for <span class="caps">TV</span> in my
room (feeding a grossly insufficient 21&#8221; <span class="caps">CRT</span> monitor), and my roommate
has a Dell <span class="caps">GX270</span> by the big <span class="caps">TV</span> in the living room, though it was running
Freevo (and now has a dead tuner and no <span class="caps">RAM</span>, or something like that).
So, I decided that I might do things right - drop a 5- or 8-port GigE
switch in the apartment, put GigE NICs in the two boxes with tuners
(putting MythTV on the <span class="caps">GX270</span> also), and setting up a centralized system.
The problem is that the ideal solution would be a single dedicated
back-end system for storage and control, with the two tuner/video out
boxes just providing A/V I/O. Unfortunately, the two boxes with tuners
are both high-spec&#8217;ed P4&#8217;s, and I&#8217;m not sure what I can come up with in
terms of a server for the&nbsp;backend.</p>
<p>Now, <span style="font-weight: bold;">the question for anyone who may be
reading</span> - I&#8217;d like to setup a good amount (1-<span class="caps">2TB</span>) of storage for
this. My roommate wants a <span class="caps">RAID</span> configuration, but I don&#8217;t see the need
for videos - if I lose my <span class="caps">TV</span> recordings, I set MythTV to record it again
the next time it&#8217;s on. Anyway, I have an 8-bay external <span class="caps">SCAI</span> enclosure
and cards in all of the servers, but <span class="caps">SCSI</span> disks are expensive. I was
thinking of going to <span class="caps">SATA</span> 3.0. Most likely, I&#8217;d get some sort of 4-8
disk enclosure, start with 1-3 disks in the 400-<span class="caps">750GB</span>&nbsp;range.</p>
<p>So, the question - what type of system specs would be needed to stream
audio and video, uncompressed, perhaps even <span class="caps">HDTV</span> (we have the <span class="caps">TV</span> and
cable box, would just need an <span class="caps">HD</span> tuner) to remote storage over the
network? I was thinking of doing either a Linux master MythTV backend
with eSATA cards, or letting each <span class="caps">TV</span> computer be its&#8217; own backend, and
then doing Solaris/<span class="caps">ZFS</span> with iSCSI or ATAoE. Any suggestions? I&#8217;m pretty
much thinking of using a PowerEdge 2550 for&nbsp;this.</p>
<p>Anyway, I&#8217;m also filling up my backup disks at home, and don&#8217;t want to
shorten my expiration cycle. My nightly backup runs put quite a strain
on my main Fast Ethernet <span class="caps">LAN</span>, so I&#8217;ve been planning for a while on
moving to GigE. My thought at home is to setup a second, separate GigE
switch/lan, with GigE NICs in all of the servers. Not exactly cheap, but
I can pickup a Linux-/Solaris-compatible Negear <span class="caps">GA311</span> for around $40, in
addition to the Intel Pro/1000 <span class="caps">XT</span> and Asante GigaNIC that I already
have. The problem here is finding a good GigE switch - I&#8217;d really like
something with Telnet, <span class="caps">SNMP</span>, VLANs, the&nbsp;works.</p>
<p>
In other news, I highly recommend reading the [Groklaw story on
Microsoft&#8217;s latest pledge for interoperability][]. I especially liked
the one quote from the [<span class="caps">ECIS</span>][] statement:

> For years now, Microsoft has either failed to implement or has
> actively corrupted a range of truly open standards adopted and
> implemented by the rest of the industry. Unless and until that
> behaviour stops, today&#8217;s words mean nothing.
>
> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>More fundamentally, today&#8217;s announcement is still all about the rest
of the world interoperating with Microsoft on Microsoft&#8217;s own terms,
not the other way&nbsp;around.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
There&#8217;s even links to \*ten\* previous Microsoft statements promising
interoperability.

> The thing is, this is a promise to interoperate with old-fashioned
> competitors. It doesn&#8217;t enable interoperability with the <span class="caps">GPL</span>, which is
> not compatible with patent licenses, and that is Microsoft&#8217;s true
> competition.
> </p>

<p>
From Michael Cunningham, <span class="caps">VP</span> and General Counsel of Red Hat:

> Eight years ago the <span class="caps">U.S.</span> regulatory authorities, and four years ago
> the European regulators made clear to Microsoft that its refusal to
> disclose interface information for its monopoly software products
> violates the law. So, it is hardly surprising to see even Microsoft
> state today that “interoperability across systems is an important
> requirement” and announce a “change in [its] approach to
> interoperability.” Of course, we’ve heard similar announcements
> before, almost always strategically timed for other effect. Red Hat
> regards this most recent announcement with a healthy dose of
> skepticism. Three commitments by Microsoft would show that it really
> means what it is announcing today:
>
> -   Commit to open standards: Rather than pushing forward its
>     proprietary, Windows-based formats for document processing, <span class="caps">OOXML</span>,
>     Microsoft should embrace the existing <span class="caps">ISO</span>-approved, cross-platform
>     industry standard for document processing, Open Document Format
>     (<span class="caps">ODF</span>) at the International Standards Organization’s meeting next
>     week in Geneva. Microsoft, please demonstrate implementation of an
>     existing international open standard now rather than make press
>     announcements about intentions of future standards support.
> -   Commit to interoperability with open source: Instead of offering a
>     patent license for its protocol information on the basis of
>     licensing arrangements it knows are incompatible with the <span class="caps">GPL</span> –
>     the world’s most widely used open source software license –
>     Microsoft should extend its Open Specification Promise to all of
>     the interoperability information that it is announcing today will
>     be made available. The Open Specification Promise already covers
>     many Microsoft products that do not have monopoly market
>     positions. If Microsoft were truly committed to fostering openness
>     and preventing customer lock-in, it would extend this promise to
>     the protocol and interface information it intends to disclose
>     today. There is no explanation for refusing to extend the Open
>     Specification Promise to “high-volume” products, other than a
>     continued intention on Microsoft’s part to lock customers into its
>     monopoly products, and lock out competitors through patent
>     threats.
> -   Commit to competition on a level playing field: Microsoft’s
>     announcement today appears carefully crafted to foreclose
>     competition from the open source community. How else can you
>     explain a “promise not to sue open source developers” as long as
>     they develop and distribute only\*/ “non-commercial”
>     implementations of interoperable products? This is simply
>     disingenuous. The only hope for reintroducing competition to the
>     monopoly markets Microsoft now controls – Windows, Office, etc. –
>     is through commercial distributions of competitive open source
>     software products.

Amen!!!
